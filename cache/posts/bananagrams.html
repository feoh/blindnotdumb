<p>Michelle and I have been having a lot of fun playing this game lately. It's a must play if you're a word game fan of any stripe, and even if you don't generally enjoy board games (especially if you find them too slow).</p>
<p>What makes this one unique is that it all happens in real time. My lovely wife is a real shark at this and every other word game we've played, but we both end up having a lot more fun with this than most others we've tried.</p>
<p>Two thumbs up.</p>
