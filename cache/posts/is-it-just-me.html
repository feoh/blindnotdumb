<p>Or has the number of new programming languages been increasing exponentially of late?</p>
<p>I don't just mean the number of new languages being <strong>invented</strong>, because that's always been the case, but the number which are actually garnering a fair bit of tech buzz?</p>
<p>In the last few months, I've heard a LOT about Clojure, Scala, Factor, and most recently Google's Go.</p>
<p>I can't help but wonder if maybe we should stop inventing new programming languages and paradigms, and maybe focus on using the ones we have already more effectively and creatively.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I'm just getting old :)</p>
