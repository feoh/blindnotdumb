<p>I've been using Chrome for the last few years, and generally speaking I'm pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>However recently Google has made some decisions (notably the on by default voice search features) that make me question the wisdom of that choice.</p>
<p>I also very much enjoy using Firefox, a 100% open source browser that's very actively developed by the awesome folks over at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a>.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There is one feature that keeps me from making the switch though, and that's their 'multiple profiles' feature. So, in my case, I have one profile for work stuff and another</div>
<div class="line">for personal.</div>
</div>
<p>My personal profile is signed in with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:cpatti&#64;gmail.com">cpatti&#64;gmail.com</a> and has all my personal default tabs, bookmarks and saved info, the other has all my stuff for my current job.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sure, Firefox can have multiple profiles too, but Chrome makes it seamless, even allowing you to have a browser window open with each profile simultaneously. So I can keep</div>
<div class="line">my personal browser window open when I feel like it, Check my Gmail etc, but if I'm in deep focus mode I can close it altogether and POOF, it's gone.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I submitted a feature request bit of feedback to <a class="reference external" href="https://input.mozilla.org">Input</a> but I'm sure they're deluged. Who knows, can't hurt, and I do think the fine folks over at</div>
<div class="line">Mozilla are worth getting behind. It's important to have a major browser that's free of commercial controlling interests.</div>
</div>
<p>As always, just my $.02!</p>
