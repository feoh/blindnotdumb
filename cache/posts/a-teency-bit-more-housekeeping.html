<p>I'm switching the static site generator I ues for this blog from <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this - better/more theme options, a more active development community, and some really swank features I just love.</p>
<p>The up-shot however is that the RSS feeds will need to change. The new links are clearly signposted on the header at the top of the blog.</p>
<p>Also, I've switched the comment system from Disqus (Which I really Dis-like :) to <a href="https://www.intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a> which I've been using on my personal blog and love to bits.</p>
<p>You can find the old Disqus comments <a href="https://disqus.com/home/forum/blindnotdumb/">here</a></p>
<p>Thanks for understanding and updating your feed readers!</p>
