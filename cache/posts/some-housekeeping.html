<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Just a brief house-keeping note.</p>
<p>This is going to hence-forth be strictly my professional blog.</p>
<p>I'll be cleaning out old posts that aren't tech related and <em>maybe</em>
moving any I feel particularly inclined to keep over to my new personal
blog, <a href="https://playingwithquicksilver.net">Playing With Quicksilver</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to hide anything, so feel free to browse my old posts via the
Wayback Machine over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211225090030/https://www.feoh.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to blogging here more often! I'll likely also be switching to
the <a href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> static site generator because it offers 
a number of features and creature comforts that will make my life easier
(Like having a command that will pre-seed a new post with all the right metadata fields. Yay :)</p>
<p>As always feel free to hit me up here or on social media if you have any thoughts.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
