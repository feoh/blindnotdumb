<p>Over a month ago now, my wife and I went on vacation with her boss and friend and another friend of hers to Ireland...</p>
<p>We took the CIE 'A Taste of Ireland&quot; bus tour, and had an amazing time. This was my first trip to Europe, and unsurprisingly, I found it amazing.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ireland is definitely a party country, if there could be said to be such a thing :) It seemed like there were Guinness taps everywhere. Being</div>
<div class="line">rather a fan, this could hardly be considered a problem for me :)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Speaking of Guinness, on our first day we visited the Guinness brewery in St. James Gate. The initial 'tour' is kind of neat, although mostly just</div>
<div class="line">multimedia presentations and the like about how it's made. The real bonanza however, and the reason that I feel no Guinness fan should miss a visit,</div>
<div class="line">is the 'Gravity Bar' on the top floor of the brewery. You only get 1 pint of Guinness (probably to cut down on loitering and move people through) but</div>
<div class="line">I have to say it's the best pint I've ever tasted. Most of the other pubs we visited had fine Guinness, but really it wasn't particularly any more</div>
<div class="line">tasty than a pint drawn at a really good pub here in the US that knows how to handle its Guinness.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The bus tour itself was incredible, but a bit grueling. A typical day involved getting up at 6:30 to get to breakfast at 7:30 so we could pile onto</div>
<div class="line">the bus for 8:00. After that, it was a dizzying whirl wind of destinations and picture taking, and usually around 5:30 in the evening they'd dump</div>
<div class="line">us at our destination where we'd be staying for the night, and we'd all crawl away to freshen up and try to recover enough to enjoy the evening's</div>
<div class="line">festivities :) In addition to the sheer endurance required for the trip, we definitely experienced the expected feeling that in a number of cases,</div>
<div class="line">we would have *REALLY* liked to have more time to explore (For instance we never kissed the Blarney Stone because we had exactly 2.5 hours to</div>
<div class="line">have lunch, explore the Blarney Woolen Mills, and visit Castle Blarney!).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I won't detail everything we saw, it would get boring for both of us and there's no point - consult a good travel guide and you'll get better</div>
<div class="line">writing than I can muster anyway. A couple of tidbits I particularly enjoyed were seeing Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a stop we made</div>
<div class="line">at a working sheep farm (You have no idea what it actually sounds like to have 1,000 sheep being herded :) ), and a buggy ride through Kilarney</div>
<div class="line">National Park with a stop at Castle Ross, whose ruins are still in remarkably good shape allowing you to wander around, climb the ramparts, and</div>
<div class="line">generally get up close and personal in the kind of relaxed way I most enjoy exploring a place.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My talented wife took about a billion pictures - I took a few as well but if you see the angle skewed oddly it's probably mine - she has a real</div>
<div class="line">eye for composition! You can look at them on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/feoh/sets/72157605216185951/">Flickr</a></div>
<div class="line">if you like.</div>
</div>
<p>Maybe we'll go to Italy next year, if I don't convince her that a nice relaxing sunny beach vacation on an island somewhere is the way to go :)</p>
