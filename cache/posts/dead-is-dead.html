<p>I had a rather 'meta' moment today after reading another article bemoaning the death of the PC as a gaming platform (An assertion of at best dubious nature).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Taking a step back, I realized that just about every single instance of someone wailing &quot;X is DEAD!&quot; turned out to either be patently untrue or at least a severely twisted view of the facts at hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;The desktop is dead. The web *IS* the platform!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;PC gaming is dead. Next gen consoles rule supreme!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Disco is dead!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;God is dead!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Paul is (a) dead(man)!&quot;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Table top role playing is dead!&quot;</div>
</div>
<p>You get the idea. Clearly, we need to re-examine our conceptions around exactly what it means for something to be dead.</p>
<p>&quot;This blog is DEAD!&quot;</p>
<p>Ahem. Maybe not :)</p>
