<p>I am at best a poor writer. Even so, certain things get under my skin...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If I never hear or see the word &quot;the&quot; intentionally misspelled as &quot;teh&quot; again, I will be a happy man.</p></li>
<li><p>3lyt3 5p3ak can just <strong>GO AWAY</strong> too, really.</p></li>
<li><p>Just sayin'. This may have been effective about 20 years ago when the first person who propagated this <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a>, but now it's tired. So <strong>very</strong> tired.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics">ebonics</a> - I like rap. A good friend many years ago in college walked up to me one day when I was ranting at some friends about how I thought rap was just chaotic noise and nothing else, and said &quot;Rap is one of the most politically active forms of music on the planet, and that's a fact.&quot;. He was right. All that's beside the point though, ebonics are seeping their way into main stream speech in ways I find most unfortunate. It can stop any time now.</p></li>
<li><p>Wassssssuupppppp!!! - the original Bud marketing campaign was brilliant, and even funny in spots (I still enjoy the sushi bar version - Wasabii!!!) but this meme is so tired it needs to be taken out back and shot - a mercy kill at that.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling everyone &quot;Kid&quot; whether they be 18 or 80 - Maybe the denizens of Southie can get grand fathered in on this one, I dunno, but the rest of you should really stop watching those Martin Scorsese.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I said above, I realize that in truth I have no business at all airing my English usage peeves, because in truth I am a sloppy writer and a downright poor grammarian. But anyway, I feel better having gotten them off my chest :).</p>
