<p>So, after suffering a few years with a flaky iPad Air 2, my lovely wife convinced me that it was OK to treat myserlf last week, and I got myself a 9.7&quot; iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've been super unhappy with Apple keyboards of late. They seem to think that everything should be a laptop keyboard - super - <strong>compact</strong> layout and a super squishy typing feel.</p>
<p>However, i my opinionÂ Apple's superior mechanical designers are firing on all cylinders with the new iPad Pro Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p>The layout feels like a regular laptop keyboard. The keys aren't cramped at all like the ones on the old iPad Air 2 Keyboartd case I used to own, and the typing feel is surprisingly good for a device that folds into the caser and barely adds a quarter inch to the combined thickness of the device with the case closed.</p>
<p>It's also notably lighter than the old keyboard case, which added markedly to the overall weight of my iPad.</p>
<p>As I write this I'm 35,000 feet up in an airplane on my way to a Florida vacation to visit my in-laws and two of my best friends who recently moved there.</p>
<p>Typing on this keyboard is surprisingly comfortable. In fact I'll go out on a limb and say it's the most comfortable mobile keyboard I've ever used.</p>
<p>Unlike other iPad keyboards, the Smart Keyboard mates with the iPaad Pro through a mag connector where the case attaches to the iPad. This means that Bluetooth pairing isn't required which is a big win. Anyone who's used a Bluetooth keyboard will know that they can sometimes need to be repaired, usually at the least convenie moments.</p>
<p>There's also no external power source required - no battery to worry about having to charge or fiddle extra cables to have to haul around.</p>
<p>It's more expensive than the average Bluetooth keyboard, but from where I sit you get a lot of value for those extra dollars.</p>
<p>In short, this keyboard is precisely the kind of super elegant, ergonomic design with unusual attention to detail that made me an Apple hardware fan all those years ago.</p>
