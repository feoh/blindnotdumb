<p>It feels like there are new security issues around WordPress every week.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the fact that WordPress automatically updates itself helps <strong>a lot</strong>, but it does lead one to wonder if a simpler solution might make more sense.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of a static generator tool like <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, but also really enjoy blogging from my mobile devices with tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://blogsyapp.com/">Blogsy</a>.</p>
<p>One friend suggested using Pelican, and using Github's built-in editor to create the Markdown, so I suppose I should explore that.</p>
<p>What I would <strong>really</strong>  love to see is a solution where I could compose on my mobile devices in Markdown, then somehow get those changes checked into Github so I could statically generate my blog later from a computer.</p>
<p>Apparently, I want everything :)</p>
<p>A middle of the road solution might be to simply give up and let <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> manage my blog, but I think it's helpful to keep some skin in the game and run my own site given that I build infrastructure for a living.</p>
<p>If anyone reading this has any amazing solutions to the problems I pose here I'd love to hear about it!</p>
