Note that my opinions are mine and not my employers (That should go without saying, but anyway).</p>
<p>In the off hours I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife, playing games of all kinds (but especially those involving face to face human interaction like board games or tabletop RPGs), reading (I have a rather severe case of bibliophilia which I've had to throttle back quite a bit now that I'm sharing my life with someone. Thankfully, she's very understanding :), and dabbling in digital art.</p>
