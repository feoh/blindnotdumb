<p>Read no further if you think Phish is just a misspelling of those things with fins and scales......</p>
<p>Does anyone know which Phish album and song contains an A Cappella version of the mourner's kaddish?</p>
<p>I know it's out there somewhere because I've heard it multiple times, I just can't for the life of me remember which album it's on.</p>
<p> <strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>The answer is that it's not the mourner's kaddish, but is instead a Jewish funerary song called &quot;Jerusalem, City of Gold&quot; and is included at the end of the song &quot;Demand&quot; on Phish's &quot;Hoist&quot; album.  View most of the details over  <a class="reference external" href="https://feoh.livejournal.com/82847.html?view=193951#t193951">here.</a></p>
