<div class="line">This is absolutely great news for the J2ME development community, this is a mainstream device from a big name manufacturer where they can ply their existing skill set or port their existing apps.</div>
</div>
<p>However, I'm a bit disappointed. I realize that the Kindle is meant as a light weight device, but I have always found J2ME's I/O model to be rather cripplingly baroque in so many ways.</p>
<p>Looking over Amazon's APIDoc however, it does seem like they've built their own infrastructure atop J2ME, so perhaps they've made it easier and more pleasant to code for.</p>
<p>I'm torn between wanting to get in on the ground floor and not wanting to invest the time and energy in learning a technology (J2ME) which I feel has gone way past its expiry date.</p>
<p>Anyway, we'll see but I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on this one.</p>
