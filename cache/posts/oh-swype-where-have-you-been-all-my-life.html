<p>For years my Android using friends have been revving about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.swype.com">Swype</a>.</p>
<p>When tablets and smartphones first appeared on the scene, many of us were so awash in the glow of our shiny new toys that we overlooked a glaring weak point - text input.</p>
<p>In a stunning display of uncreative design, the keyboards for these devices were simply 'virtualized' versions of their mechanical counterparts.</p>
<p>The result seems like a regular keyboard, but bereft of the comparative elegance and efficiency of touch typing we are left in an incredibly unsatisfying state of perpetual hunt and peck. To add insult to injury, this ethereal target we're eternally stabbing at changes underneath us to suit the whim of the author of whichever app we're using.</p>
<p>With Swype, one simply glides one's finger from letter to letter spelling our words. Swype handles tedious details like putting spaces between words or after periods.</p>
<p>I could keep babbling, but suffice it to say it has been a life changer for me. Paired with <a class="reference external" href="https://blogsyapp.com">Blogsy</a>, my iPad blogging ttyl of choice, you may be hearing from me more often!</p>
