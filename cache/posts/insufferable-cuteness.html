<p>As anyone who knows me can attest, I was owned by a Golden for years back in my pre college days, and I've been wanting another one ever since.</p>
<p>Happily, my wife is also an easy mark for such a big adorable fluff ball, so I might have a shot at it :)</p>
<p>Time to go take our after dinner walk.</p>
