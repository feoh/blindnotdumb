<div class="line">For years I've been rather proud of the fact that I'm a total polyglot when it</div>
<div class="line">comes to editors. I'm comfortable on both sides of the fence, using Emacs, Vi,</div>
<div class="line">TextMate, EditPlus, or even the venerable /bin/ed whenever that makes sense.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But for the first time in a long time, my current (awesome! :)) job at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluestatedigital.com">Blue
State Digital</a> has given me the opportunity to</div>
<div class="line">branch out and do quite a bit of real software development.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I first encountered TextMate shortly after I came to OSX. It's a great editor,</div>
<div class="line">and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Alan Odegard of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.macromates.com">Macromates</a></div>
<div class="line">software. He has just about single handedly created not only an amazing</div>
<div class="line">editor, but a vibrant and loyal community around his program, and he's to be</div>
<div class="line">commended for that.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I would have remained happy in TextMate land, but for the fact that my most</div>
<div class="line">recent job has me going back to where it all started for me - server side UNIX,</div>
<div class="line">Linux to be exact.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So, I editing files on my Mac using Expandrive to remotely mount them, but</div>
<div class="line">quite frankly that's a pain in the neck I just don't need to deal with.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With Vim, I can memorize one set of keystrokes for everywhere I might need to</div>
<div class="line">be.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And with MacVim, I get a nicely streamlined, beautifully Aqua-fied interface,</div>
<div class="line">with all the creature comforts TextMate provides and more.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">What's more, there are a number of folks making the same transition, so there</div>
<div class="line">are some excellent articles and websites out there to ease the transition like</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="https://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/09/05/textmate-to-vim.html#masthead">this guide on making the
switch</a> or</div>
<div class="line">the excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://vimcasts.org">VimCasts</a> series of Vim tutorial screen</div>
<div class="line">casts. They cover everything from the basics to some fairly advanced tips and</div>
<div class="line">tricks on more complex Vim modes and integrations, and is written by a TextMate</div>
<div class="line">to Vim switcher.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Right now I'm writing this post on the excellent</div>
<div class="line"><a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3510">VimRePress</a> plugin for</div>
<div class="line">Vim that allows you to author and manage your Wordpress blog right from within</div>
<div class="line">the editor! Very sweet :)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So, it's a brave new world, and I'm excited by the opportunity to get</div>
<div class="line"><strong>really</strong> good at Vim so I can push my editing productivity through the roof</div>
<div class="line">:)</div>
