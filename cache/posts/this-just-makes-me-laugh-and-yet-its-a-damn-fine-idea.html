<p>Go take a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.flocabulary.com/">Flocabulary</a></p>
<p>The piece that actually left me chuckling on this snowy wet morning was <a class="reference external" href="https://www.flocabulary.com/shakessample2.html">this</a>. A Hip hopped up Cliffs Notes version of Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>I love the idea - speaking to kids using a medium they're comfortable with. In no way do I think this should replace a full and careful reading with explanations by the teacher, but for some children there's a lot of ground to cover before they're able or ready to be successful in such an endeavor.</p>
<p>Kudos to <a class="reference external" href="https://mightyredpen.wordpress.com/">The Mighty Red Pen</a> for coming up with this. For those who don't read it, I highly recommend it. It's funny and educational - it doesn't get much better than that!</p>
