<div class="line">No, I'm not talking about reading, writing, and 'rithmitic, I'm</div>
<div class="line">talking about the three Rs that are critical in creating and keeping a</div>
<div class="line">software organization strong.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The three Rs in this case are Rigor, Resources, and Raison</div>
<div class="line">d'etre. Let's take a look at each of these in turn.</div>
</div>
<section id="resources">
<h1>Resources</h1>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I begin with resources because when push comes to shove</div>
<div class="line">this is one of the most important factors in making your team a</div>
<div class="line">success.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Am I saying that you can't build an incredible team with nothing but</div>
<div class="line">the sheer will to bring your idea to fruition? Hell no. I'm saying</div>
<div class="line">that good will only goes so far. After a while you will need to pay</div>
<div class="line">your people what they're worth, <em>and</em> be able to hire enough help that</div>
<div class="line">individual contributors don't feel like they're being exploited and</div>
<div class="line">suffering from burn out.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is a mistake I'm seeing more and more companies make over time.</div>
<div class="line">Modern development techniques <em>are</em> increasing our overall</div>
<div class="line">productivity dramatically, but they are not a substitute for having</div>
<div class="line">enough man power to do the job you need done in the time frame the</div>
<div class="line">business demands.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You can't substitute creature comforts for this either. No amount of</div>
<div class="line">free snacks, soda, coffee or snuggles will make an engineer who's</div>
<div class="line">working night and day with no time to take care of themselves</div>
<div class="line">happy. These things are nice add-one and <em>can</em> make employees feel</div>
<div class="line">valued, but <em>only</em> when they're in addition to an environment that gets</div>
<div class="line">the basics right.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There are other aspects to being properly resourced. Be sure you can</div>
<div class="line">afford the equipment you need. If your business demands that you run a</div>
<div class="line">data center, <em>do it right</em>! If you don't, you will increase the</div>
<div class="line">frustration your employees have to deal with day to day to get their</div>
<div class="line">jobs done, and that will seep into overall job satisfaction very</div>
<div class="line">quickly.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There's more to say on this - good office work environments including</div>
<div class="line">sit/stand desks, keyboard trays or whatever else your employees need</div>
<div class="line">to be productive without harming themselves. Don't skimp on this</div>
<div class="line">stuff, it's super important, and your employees will thank you for it.</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="rigor">
<h1>Rigor</h1>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I wrestled with myself a bit as to whether this should come</div>
<div class="line">first or second, but anyway, Here we go. We all know that having</div>
<div class="line">rigorous processes as individual contributors and organizations is</div>
<div class="line">important. It's what enables us to deliver quality software in a</div>
<div class="line">timely fashion and bring value to our customers.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">However a lot of people, including some very experienced engineers,</div>
<div class="line">seem to think that how we get there is some kind of magical journey to</div>
<div class="line">another dimension, only attainable by the assistance of some wizard or</div>
<div class="line">ascetic.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But the cold, hard, in-sexy truth is that it's all about</div>
<div class="line">discipline. Doing precisely the same set of things over and over again</div>
<div class="line">until they become second nature, &quot;baked in&quot; whatever you want to call</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Let's take code reviews as an example. I can't even begin to tell you</div>
<div class="line">the difference I've seen between strong organizations and weak ones,</div>
<div class="line">and almost inevitably, how teams handle code review is the canary in</div>
<div class="line">the coal mine.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'm not suggesting that code reviews in and of themselves are some</div>
<div class="line">kind of magical panacea that will make your organization great, but</div>
<div class="line">chances are good that if you're doing regular code reviews with every</div>
<div class="line">merge, you're also doing testing. If you're doing comprehensive</div>
<div class="line">testing, you're probably also taking the time to write good</div>
<div class="line">documentation. The list goes on and on.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Everybody knows these are good things, but why are so many</div>
<div class="line">organizations slow to adopt them? Well, as usual with such things,</div>
<div class="line">It's Complicated. One contributing factor is definitely team size</div>
<div class="line">versus work load, as outlined in the section on Resources.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Individual contributors who are working straight out all the time</div>
<div class="line">aren't going to take the time to do proper code reviews, and chances</div>
<div class="line">are good that in such organizations, their managers won't be pushing</div>
<div class="line">for them either. It's a kind of myopia that cripples teams and</div>
<div class="line">actually hurts the business both short term and long. Some people are</div>
<div class="line">beginning to see that, but it's something we should all be aware of</div>
<div class="line">and actively promoting within our organizations wherever we are on the</div>
<div class="line">discipline curve.</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="raison-d-etre">
<h1>Raison d'etre</h1>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is about <em>vision</em>. I know, we've all had that</div>
<div class="line">word misused, abused, and generally beaten to death so much over the</div>
<div class="line">course of our careers that most of us cringe when we hear it. However</div>
<div class="line">no other word embodies what I'm trying to get at in quite the same</div>
<div class="line">way.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In order to form a cohesive unit - something we all agree is critical</div>
<div class="line">to success, we all have to know where we're going. What precisely are</div>
<div class="line">we trying to build, and why? Where's the value for our customers, and</div>
<div class="line">where do we see our product going in the future?</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I've encountered many organizations where this isn't clear at all, and</div>
<div class="line">when that happens, a sort of spiritual malaise sets in. It's like a</div>
<div class="line">disease, spreading up through the ranks and sapping job satisfaction</div>
<div class="line">and pride in workmanship.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Fixing things once your organization has gone this way is hard. I</div>
<div class="line">mean, <em>really</em> hard, because regaining the trust of your team is not</div>
<div class="line">something you can do over night. You'll need to overcome years of hard</div>
<div class="line">earned scar tissue before people will be able to have the confidence</div>
<div class="line">in you and your product that are necessary for success. There are no</div>
<div class="line">clear cut prescriptions to make here, because each organization's path</div>
<div class="line">to healing will depend on the nature and scale of the wounds.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Much easier to start on the right foot and stay that way. Doing so is</div>
<div class="line">actually straight forward. The key is having a clear vision yourself,</div>
<div class="line">and communicating that with your team.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I realize our business is a harm scarum one and that changes in</div>
<div class="line">direction are not only inevitable but desirable to meet changing</div>
<div class="line">conditions in the field, but how those changes are handled and the</div>
<div class="line">frequency with which they occur can mean the difference between an</div>
<div class="line">organization that thrives and a cadre of walking wounded, shambling</div>
<div class="line">from one death march to the next until they take too much damage and</div>
<div class="line">decide to ply their trade elsewhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hiring and layoffs are another aspect of employee trust whose import</div>
<div class="line">should not be underestimated. When you hire, hire for the long haul</div>
<div class="line"><em>or</em> be crystal clear about what your expectations are &quot;We're trying</div>
<div class="line">this risky new thing and you're here to make that happen. If it</div>
<div class="line">doesn't work out, we may need to go our separate ways.&quot; I can't</div>
<div class="line">imagine anyone who wouldn't appreciate knowing that up front, and if</div>
<div class="line">they have even a tiny amount of character and maturity, if that's the</div>
<div class="line">way it plays out when the time comes, you can walk away friends. It's</div>
<div class="line">a booming industry out there and there are no shortage of jobs.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If they must happen, layoffs should be handled quickly and</div>
<div class="line">professionally. You need to be <em>crystal</em> clear with both the people</div>
<div class="line">being laid off and the people left behind as to why this is happening</div>
<div class="line">from the perspective of the business. The people who are left will be</div>
<div class="line">nervous and unsettled, and they'll be able to recover <em>much</em> more</div>
<div class="line">quickly if everything is handled in an above board way.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Again, <em>don't lie</em>. If you need to lay people off, and you have a</div>
<div class="line">flexible schedule in your office, by all means <em>do</em> send out mail</div>
<div class="line">saying &quot;mandatory meeting at X time&quot; to be sure everyone will be in</div>
<div class="line">the office, but don't tell those being laid off that it's a meeting</div>
<div class="line">about something else entirely. They will resent you for it.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Crystal clear, honest communication and clear vision will result in</div>
<div class="line">enthusiastic employees who are excited at the prospect making <em>their</em></div>
<div class="line">company a raging success.</div>
