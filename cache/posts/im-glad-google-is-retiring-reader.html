<p>Because I and about a zillion other jilted Reader fans have now found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a>.</p>
<p>Feedly is what Reader wanted to be when it grew up, but never had the chance to become.</p>
<p>Yes, it's that good.</p>
<p>Just in case anyone out there reading this is thinking &quot;Google What?&quot; - here's the skinny.  If you find yourself reading a lot of websites on a regular basis, constantly checking back to keep up to date with the latest, you REALLY want a feed reader like this.  With something like this, you can treat them all as if you were browsing articles in a newspaper or magazine, either slavishly reading every one or, as I do, cherry picking what most piques your interest from the stream (or firehose as we geeks like to refer to it :)</p>
<p>Things I love about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keyboard commands for everything - I'm a mouse hater from way back.  Force me to click at your peril :)</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple views - I can either view my stream the good old fashioned way like Reader used to do - just a big old list of text headlines, or like a newspaper with photos front and center.</p></li>
<li><p>A 'Must Read' setting for the 1% of blogs I really don't want to miss a single post from.</p></li>
<li><p>A truly superb mobile app! Can't overstate how important this is.  The iPad and iPhone apps are optimized for that format, yet as feature-ful as the desktop.  Major win! (Reader sucked at this, using it on the go was paaaainful.).</p></li>
<li><p>Laziness - if you already use Reader as I did, all your feeds import seamlessly into Feedly, and while Reader still breathes, Feedly keeps it up to date so there's zero risk in giving it a try.</p></li>
<li><p>OK I know I already mentioned the mobile experience but the iPhone app deserves special mention, it makes it *so* easy to browse my feeds on the go, marking articles I actually want to read in-depth for later perusal via one of my other faves, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getpocket.com">Pocket</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, mad props to the folks at<a class="reference external" href="https://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> for evolving the state of the art, giving me a seamless migration path, and generally taking an OK but generally pretty lackluster experience and elevating it to joy.</p>
<p>(And no, I'm not being paid by these guys, I'm just wild about the product.)</p>
