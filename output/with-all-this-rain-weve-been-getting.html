</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Staring out the window just now at the torrential rains, I had a very
vivid memory of a really pleasant day many years ago...</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I was in High School I think, and a friend of mine (He was my 'Big
Brother' actually, a program I was in for kids whose fathers weren't
around so we<br />
could get some sense of what it's like to be a man - I think it only
partially worked :) ) and I were canoeing around <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=Lake+Dennison,&amp;near=Templeton,+MA&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;latlng=9446610972854578859&amp;dtab=0&amp;ei=BLGISJHMJomKjAHY9bWhBw&amp;oi=&amp;sa=X#" title="Google Maps">Lake
Dennison</a>
in Templeton, MA.</p>
<p>There had been a lot of rain that year too, a LOT of rain, and the
lake's water level was threatening to swell over the top and flood the
beach entirely.<br />
This made for some beautiful canoeing, since it allowed us to row down
a series of inlets which would normally have been almost totally
inaccessible<br />
by foot because of the dense brush. It was just gorgeous out there, the
air smelled incredibly lush and green, and there were flowers and small
wild<br />
life all around - we managed to get within perfect viewing distance of
a doe and her fawn before they pranced away, and we're pretty sure we
disturbed<br />
the work of a beaver or two that wasn't at all used to the intrusion.</p>
<p>It's funny how when you get older (and I don't even mean ancient either,
just middle aged) memories can take on not just the rosy glow of years
long<br />
past but a strange intensity all their own.</p>
<p>I stink at canoeing, but I do hope I can go out rowing even on a row
boat or something again someday. I miss those quiet moments on the lake
:)</p>
