family...</p>

<p>... But as always we managed to sneak some fun in between the cracks.</p>
<p>We had brunch at <a href="http://www.vynl-nyc.com/" title="Vynl Locations">Vynl</a>. This
place is downright fun, from the records decorating the walls to the
album jacket menus to the bathrooms each with their own unique theme -
The Beatles, Madonna, etc. Happily, the brunch food is actually quite
good. We had and can enthusiastically recommend the banana pecan
pancakes, the brioche french toast, and the make your own omelette
option. The large glasses of tasty fresh squeezed orange juice are also
a nice touch.</p>
<p>A quick stop at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/week/20080413.html" title="Apple Store - Fifth Avenue">Manhattan Apple Store on Fifth
Avenue</a>
and were amazed at the multi-national throng as we jostled our way in
only to decide that the shopping we'd hoped to do for a relative was
impossible, and found our way out again (The place was <strong>packed</strong> -
hundreds of people at least).</p>
<p>Later in the day while trolling around for something to fill a couple of
idle hours, we ended up at the <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/bar/king_cole_bar_lounge/" title="King Cole Bar Lounge - - Midtown East - New York Magazine Bar Guide">King Cole
Lounge</a>
at the gorgeous and elegant <a href="http://specialoffers.starwoodhotels.com/stregisnyc" title="St. Regis New York Hotels: The St. Regis New York - Hotel Rooms at stregis.com">St. Regis
Hotel</a>.
If you're lucky enough to get a table (We only scored one due to the
generosity of a couple whose party unexpectedly shrank due to the
departure of some friends) you'll be treated to a viewing of a beautiful
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish" title="Maxfield Parrish - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Maxfield
Parrish</a>
mural depicting King Cole looking on bemusedly at the festivities. The
drinks are stiff, well made and very tasty, and the bar snacks are
unusually good. I had a Big Apple Manhattan and the ladies got
Pomegranate martinis which both got rave reviews. Apparently, the Red
Snapper cocktail they serve here is the ancestor to the modern <a href="http://www.twoop.com/food_drink/archives/2005/10/bloody_mary_cocktail.html" title="Bloody Mary Cocktail Timeline and History">Bloody
Mary</a>.</p>
<p>Having wiled away the aforementioned time in tipsy elegance, we made our
way over to<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shunleepalace.com%2Fnewyork%2F&amp;ei=vO4ESL3YFY7yecP24CI&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEWKSfl83bO3oX2vVkKtUVqFI1Aw&amp;sig2=IeMl8zEpihNS7h89isd5ug">Shun Li
Palace</a>
where we met up with some other family for dinner. This is perhaps not
the most authentic Chinese food I've ever encountered, but wow is it
tasty. Also, the atmosphere is decidedly upscale. There is a significant
wine list, and the staff are decked out in full suit attire.</p>
<p>Between too many bar snacks and a lovely dinner, we waddled back to our

(Yay Priceline. We'd never have stayed there otherwise) and passed out
in a happy blissful drink and dinner induced haze :)</p>
