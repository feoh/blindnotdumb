<p>If you're new to the world of Windows scripting as I am, the array of
acronyms, technologies and access methodologies that you need to
traverse in order to get anything done can range from bewildering on a
good day to utterly derangement inducing on a bad one.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I've been doing installer and deployment development at a Windows
enterprise software company for the last year or so, and after decades
spent comfortably swaddled in the familiarity of the UNIX and Java
world, I definitely found myself feeling shell shocked, disoriented, and
frustrated at the lack of any sort of cohesive resources to aid me in my
quest.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been doing its best to pretend VBScript doesn't exist -
touting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/PowerShell/" title="Windows PowerShell">Windows
PowerShell</a> as
the way and the light.  PowerShell is indeed an awesome tool, and I for
one would happily consign VBScript to the briny deeps never to be
thought of again were it not for one little problem - the vast majority
of Windows systems running in the wild don't have PowerShell
installed.   Until a new day dawns and PowerShell is on *every single*
Windows box our company wants to install its software on, VBScript
remains the lowest common denominator for system scripting and thus the
only <strong>real</strong> game in town for install time scripting.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is not to teach you VBScript, sadly, there are
essentially no books and precious few online resources dedicated to this
topic online.  I will offer pointers to those that I have found most
useful, and some collected wisdom on how to best make use of them, as
well as some pitfalls I encountered which with any luck I can help you
avoid.</p>
<p>That said, let's get started.</p>
<h2>2. Learning VBScript</h2>
<p>This will mostly be a collection of pointers to resources with a smidgen
of commentary on each to get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<h3>A. Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-XP-Annoyances-Geeks-2nd/dp/0596008767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270065442&amp;sr=8-1" title="Windows XP Annoyances">Windows XP
    Annoyances</a> -
    This book should really be titled "Windows For Geeks" :) it is the
    single most useful book I have ever encountered for someone trying
    to make the transition from another environment and isn't content to
    just grit their teeth and groan at all the annoying defaults Windows
    ships with.  In addition to an incredible amount of depth around the
    Windows registry and how you can wield it to suit your needs, this
    book also has one of the best simple introductions to system
    scripting with VBScript I've seen.  Two thumbs up. Note that this is
    the 1997 edition, and this book now comes in Windows Vista and
    Windows 7 flavors which I haven't read, but can only assume are
    equally awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.visualbasicscript.com/" title="VBScript Forums">visualbasicscript.com</a> -
    This is far and away the single best VBScript resources on the
    intertubes.  The folks in these forums are experts, and will help
    you solve your problem virtually every time.  I can't say enough
    about the incredible community here.  Nine out of ten times, if I go
    looking somewhere else first I end up coming back here and wishing I
    hadn't wasted my time elsewhere first :)</li>
<li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/default.aspx" title="The Scripting Guys">Microsoft Script Center / The Scripting
    Guys</a> -
    The second most useful scripting site on the web.  The Scripts
    Repository and "Scripting Guys" MSDN blog are an incredible resource
    for system scripters.  While the emphasis has definitely shifted
    towards PowerShell these days (and rightfully so) most of the
    techniques discussed can be leveraged in VBScript once you get cozy
    with the syntactic differences between the two (very different)
    languages.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d1et7k7c%28v=VS.85%29.aspx">MSDN Windows Scripting
    Technologies</a> -
    This page covers things like the Windows Scripting Host, the core
    technology that actually allows you to perform useful work in
    VBScript.  While somewhat more complete than the VBScript reference
    itself, it's no great shakes.  You'll find yourself learning much
    more from examples published elsewhere, but for the occasional API
    lookup or clarification it can be useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t0aew7h6%28VS.85%29.aspx" title="VBScript Reference">MSDN VBscript
    Reference</a> -
    You'll note this site's position well down the list.  It's there for
    a reason.  The documentation provided here is very sketchy and
    frankly incredibly misleading in places.  The authors seem to have
    weaseled out of writing a more complete documentation set by making
    a vacuous assertion along the lines of "Well, it's just like regular
    Visual Basic, with a few minor differences".  This leaves people
    like myself who have never had the need to touch a fully fledged VB
    implementation out in the cold, feeling like second class citizens. 
    While these pages can be useful for occasional clarification on some
    obscure language feature, those seeking to understand how the
    language works in the large should definitely look elsewhere.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308364">Windows Script Debugging Microsoft KB
    Article</a> - This article will
    get you started interactively debugging your scripts using Visual
    Studio.  Don't bother with the Windows Script Debugger, Visual
    Studio Express is free and much better :)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/vbscript/default.asp">W3Schools VBScript
    Tutorial/Reference</a> -
    This page is definitely rather Web-centric, focusing on VBScript in
    classic ASP programming, however, the core language and some of the
    techniques are the same.  In many cases this is a better reference
    than the MSDN one, and the tutorial lets you work through the
    examples online in a web browser which is cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Debugging</h2>
<h3>Who turned the lights out?</h3>
<p>If you find that some script you've inherited is not working, but you
get exactly zero output or errors, look for the telltale
<code>On Error Goto 0</code> or <code>On Error Resume Next</code> statements. These basically
disable VBScript's inherent error handling functionality and cause your
script to silently ignore errors. Helpful, eh?</p>
<h3>Never run while blind folded.</h3>
<p>Know how you're invoking your VBScript. If you're calling your script
from an installer or some such executable, you're likely using
Microsoft's <code>cscript</code> tool. which doesn't do a very good job of always
displaying handy things like syntax or run time errors. Try running your
script with <code>wscript</code> instead for debugging purposes. Heretofore
mysterious behavior may become clear :)</p>
<h3>That's all!</h3>
<p>Hopefully this post will prove useful to some poor soul, manacled in
place, suffering through their own personal Windows induced hell. Even
if it isn't, these tidbits have been rattling around in my head since I
escaped (I now work for <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com" title="Blue State Digital: Design. Strategy. Technology">Blue State
Digital</a>,
we're a LAMPs shop (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and I hope to never be
trapped in Windows enterprise limbo again!</p>
