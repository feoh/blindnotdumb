Like any civic minded person about to vote in tomorrow's MA senatorial
election tomorrow, I was browsing the candidates websites so I could
make an informed choice.

</div>

<div>

I am honestly not the biggest Coakley fan, but given the two choices
she's a shining star compared to Scott Brown.

</div>

<p>I have no issue with most of the points he puts forth in the "Issues"
section of his website, right up until we get to "Marriage" -
conveninetly located third from the bottom, just above "Israel" and
"Iran".</p>
<h4><strong>Marriage</strong></h4>
<p>I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. States should be free to make their own laws in this area, so long as they reflect the people's will as expressed through them directly, or as expressed through their elected representatives. {style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;"}</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of state's rights, but let's view this in context - here
in Massachusetts, same sex marriage is 100% legal.  If Mr. Brown is
elected, he will strip our state of one of its proudest moments in
recent memory, plunging us back into the darkness of ignorance,
discrimination and fear that has held sway since time immemorial.</p>
<p>As a heterosexual man who has been blessed by the gift of marriage in my
life, I can't even begin to express how strongly I feel about this
issue.  To me, denying our fellow men and women this right because they
happen to be attracted to people of the same sex is so morally repugnant
as to be beyond words.</p>
<p>Do not allow the army of small mindedness and ignorance to douse the
light of truth and plunge our fair state into darkness once again.</p>
<p>Whether straight, gay, yellow or purple, if you care about the basic
rights and freedoms that make our nation as great as it is, go vote
tomorrow, and vote against Scott Brown.</p>                </article>
