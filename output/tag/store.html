</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>When Apple said they were introducing an "App Store" to OSX a-la the
iPhone, iPad, etc. there was much ranting and foaming at the
mouth...<!--more-->Many geeks proclaimed the death of Mac OS X as we
know it. "Apple is iPhone-izing the Mac!" they cried.</p>
<p>They're largely wrong, at least in all the important ways.</p>
<p>Here are the salient points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery - people are *far* more likely to purchase things that
    are available from a single, readily accessible source. Having a
    veritable floatilla of awesome software that's discoverable right
    from the Apple menu of every Mac means that if you're a publisher,
    people are FAR more likely to try your software. I myself found a
    free copy of Autodesk Sketchpad in the app store that I am very much
    enjoying. I might end up buying the commercial product as a result -
    possibly through the app store! (See caveats below for why I might
    choose the shrink wrapped version.)</li>
<li>Ease of installation - just like on the iPhone and iPad, you click
    "Buy" or "Install" and *BOOM* it's on your machine, happily
    bouncing in your dock. For non technical people, this is a godsend.
    They do not want to know about .dmg files, dragging apps to the
    Applications folder, or the like. Yes, I know, this is VASTLY easier
    than the folks in the Windows world have it with their highly
    complex installers, but even still.</li>
<li>One Stop Shopping for updates - Sure, lots of devs these days are
    bundling some kind of update mechanism into their apps, but this is
    once again - seamless and easy to use for non technical people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, every silver lining has a cloud attached, so there are a few
down sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflexible upgrade path - Apple has imposed rules around publishers
    app store offerings, I don't know all the details, but I do know
    that publishers are not happy. They want total control of how they
    monetize the sale of upgrades for their customers, and to a certain
    extent I can't blame them. Over all I think the net winner here is
    the consumer, so we'll see how many publishers sign up and
    grudgingly cope with the new rules.</li>
<li>Restrictive rules about permitted content - Nothing sexy, nothing
    violent, no Java or Rosetta, just like the IOS app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my perspective, people who object to the app store on OSX are on
shaky ground, because unlike the IOS world where the app store is the
ONLY way to get apps, the app store on OSX isn't. You can still install
apps the old fashioned way, and Apple has given <em>no</em> indocation that
they intend to do this now or at any time in the future. I don't think
it's in their best interest to do this, and I think people who are
predicting imminent doom really need to get their collective head
checked.</p>
<p>Then again, geeks do have a propensity for hysterics.</p>
<p>To sum up, I think everyone (publishers, consumers, and the wider Mac
community) has everything to gain and nothing to lose from the app
store, and I for one welcome the addition.</p>                </article>
