</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>As others have pointed out, both sides on this issue are jumping up and
down shrilly screaming the facts as they claim to see them at the top of
their lungs...</p>
<!--more-->

<p>But real, verifiable facts are mightily hard to come by. I'm personally
rather conflicted on this one.</p>
<p>Both my wife and I are serious dog people. She can spot a puppy at 500
yards in a bustling crowd.</p>
<p>She is getting all sorts of messages from the MSPCA and their ilk
claiming that the dogs are being horribly abused and that it must stop
RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>The Vote No on 3 contingent is mostly coming off sounding combative and
shrill as well. Their Boston Globe piece reminded me of conservative
talk radio - it might as well have been written by Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>The folks over at <a href="http://protectdogsandjobs.org/" title="Vote NO on Massachusetts Question 3 - Protect Dogs and Our Jobs - Home">Protect Dogs and
Jobs</a>
are citing the loss of 1,000 jobs and \$4 million in state revenue if
the ban passes, and claiming that the incidence of dog injury in the
sport is incredibly small (1 injury for every 1000 dogs racing -
something like .1%) and compare that to the injury stat for Girls
Volleyball which is at 1.47%. the only thing I keep hearing from these
folks about the abuse allegations is "Owners have every incentive to
treat their dogs well, so they'll race well" - but I'm not sure how well
that theory holds water.</p>
<p>So who is right? Are the dogs actually being abused, or is this people
getting carried away with themselves on principle and ignoring the
actual facts of the matter?</p>
<p>As a voter, it's a tough call. I have my mind pretty well made up on the
other two (No and yes respectively) but I'm very much on the fence with
this one.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any opinions on this? Or better yet any actual
experience with the way the dogs are treated?</p>
<p>[ Edit: November 3rd, tomorrow is E day :) My wife and I plan to hit the
polls early. I am no longer conflicted about this question, due to some
excellent responses I got on my LiveJournal and some tertiary research I
did as a result, I am now solidly in favor of the ban. I'm concerned
that dogs which participate in racing are adversely effected by this,
and their personalities are permanently damaged as a result. ]</p>                </article>
