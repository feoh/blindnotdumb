                <p>I guess the big news in my life of late is that I turned 40 last week!</p>
<!--more-->

<p>My wife and friends put on a really incredible party. They went over
the top decorating our house - it was beautiful. Everyone who came
seemed to have a wonderful time, and I enjoyed myself tremendously.</p>
<p>Party aside though, it's interesting how (for me anyway, other people
differ I'm sure) birthdays that end in zero inevitably engender a kind
of check pointing. An opportunity to step back, try to take an objective
look at things, and say to ones self "Am I where I want to be, and if
not, how can I get there?".</p>
<p>There are definitely a bunch of personal challenges I intend to take on
over the next decade (Around things like self discipline and career
direction) but on the whole I am exactly where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>It amazes me that <strong>10 years</strong> have flown by since I turned 30.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I was much less happy and well adjusted at that point,
and there were many things in my life I wanted and needed to change.</p>
<p>I was beginning to see foreshadows of certain decisions I had made and
paths I was treading down, but didn't have enough confidence in my own
instincts and intuition to take evasive action before it was too late.</p>
<p>It took a few years for things to spiral down to (for me) rock bottom
and then, once I made the tough changes that needed making, another
couple of years to enjoy the healthy bachelor life and truly recover,
but by thirty seven / thirty eight I had met my wife, and things have
gotten steadily (and dramatically!) better since then.</p>
<p>So as I look back across the last decade, I can't help but be reminded
of how lucky I am. I have enjoyed the support of friends and
acquaintances near and far. Each of them has contributed in some
meaningful way to who I am today, Thanks, everybody! It's been quite a
trip.</p>
<p>On to the next decade!</p>
