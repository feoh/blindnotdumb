</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My wife was kind enough to indulge my penchant for video games this
evening by helping me unpack and set up the Rock Band 2 Special Edition
box.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>It's quite a production! Lots of parts and a bit of part a slot b
assembly, but the totally picture based instructions were clear and the
instruments were <strong>very</strong> well constructed. Each part that needed to be
inserted into another gave a satisfying click when it was seated
properly, and everything had a very rugged feel - no chintzy plastic
pieces or flimsy parts.</p>
<p>The tutorials are excellent and get the player up to speed with his/her
instrument very quickly.</p>
<p>I quickly settled into playing the bass track with the guitar - there
were many fewer notes so the songs were much easier to handle.</p>
<p>My wife tried the drum set, and looking at her track as we played the
songs I was struck by how much harder her end of things was. She also
mentioned a couple of times how sensitive the drums were to being hit
exactly on center.</p>
<p>So next time I'll try the drums and she'll give the bass guitar a shot
:)</p>
<p>Anyway, I am very very impressed. As a fan of Harmoinix from way back (I
own Frequency for the PS2) it's a lot of fun to watch them evolve the
genre.</p>
<p>Looking forward to having some time to practice some more, and maybe try
out the microphone!</p>                </article>
