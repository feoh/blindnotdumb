</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Over a month ago now, my wife and I went on vacation with her boss and
friend and another friend of hers to Ireland...</p>
<!--more-->

<p>We took the CIE 'A Taste of Ireland" bus tour, and had an amazing time.
This was my first trip to Europe, and unsurprisingly, I found it
amazing.</p>
<p>Ireland is definitely a party country, if there could be said to be such
a thing :) It seemed like there were Guinness taps everywhere. Being<br />
rather a fan, this could hardly be considered a problem for me :)</p>
<p>Speaking of Guinness, on our first day we visited the Guinness brewery
in St. James Gate. The initial 'tour' is kind of neat, although mostly
just<br />
multimedia presentations and the like about how it's made. The real
bonanza however, and the reason that I feel no Guinness fan should miss
a visit,<br />
is the 'Gravity Bar' on the top floor of the brewery. You only get 1
pint of Guinness (probably to cut down on loitering and move people
through) but<br />
I have to say it's the best pint I've ever tasted. Most of the other
pubs we visited had fine Guinness, but really it wasn't particularly any
more<br />
tasty than a pint drawn at a really good pub here in the US that knows
how to handle its Guinness.</p>
<p>The bus tour itself was incredible, but a bit grueling. A typical day
involved getting up at 6:30 to get to breakfast at 7:30 so we could pile
onto<br />
the bus for 8:00. After that, it was a dizzying whirl wind of
destinations and picture taking, and usually around 5:30 in the evening
they'd dump<br />
us at our destination where we'd be staying for the night, and we'd all
crawl away to freshen up and try to recover enough to enjoy the
evening's<br />
festivities :) In addition to the sheer endurance required for the
trip, we definitely experienced the expected feeling that in a number of
cases,<br />
we would have *REALLY* liked to have more time to explore (For
instance we never kissed the Blarney Stone because we had exactly 2.5
hours to<br />
have lunch, explore the Blarney Woolen Mills, and visit Castle
Blarney!).</p>
<p>I won't detail everything we saw, it would get boring for both of us and
there's no point - consult a good travel guide and you'll get better<br />
writing than I can muster anyway. A couple of tidbits I particularly
enjoyed were seeing Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a stop we
made<br />
at a working sheep farm (You have no idea what it actually sounds like
to have 1,000 sheep being herded :) ), and a buggy ride through
Kilarney<br />
National Park with a stop at Castle Ross, whose ruins are still in
remarkably good shape allowing you to wander around, climb the ramparts,
and<br />
generally get up close and personal in the kind of relaxed way I most
enjoy exploring a place.</p>
<p>My talented wife took about a billion pictures - I took a few as well
but if you see the angle skewed oddly it's probably mine - she has a
real<br />
eye for composition! You can look at them on
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/feoh/sets/72157605216185951/" title="Ireland Tour 2008 - a set on Flickr">Flickr</a><br />
if you like.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll go to Italy next year, if I don't convince her that a nice
relaxing sunny beach vacation on an island somewhere is the way to go :)</p>                </article>
