</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>A couple of weeks back I was laid off from <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com" title="Blue State Digital">Blue State
Digital</a>.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I have nothing but admiration for them and gratitude for three great
years during which I helped re-elect the first African-American
president, helped fight for equal marriage, and make the world a better
place by doing my usual job pushing bits around.  How cool is that?</p>
<p>One upshot of this is that I'm no longer bound by the company's social
media policy.  I understand why it exists and even agree with it as far
as that goes.  When you're working for the president of the united
states, it's probably not so good if your minions start shooting their
mouths off about him.</p>
<p>The good news for me is that now I can say whatever I want :) Not that I
plan to go off half cocked and unleash raging venom on the world - I'm a
huge fan of the Obama administration and believe in a lot of what they
stand for.</p>
<p>But nobody's perfect, and neither is he or his administration. I will
write more about this as I collect my thoughts, but just off the top of
my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would love to see his administration take a hard-line stance on
    decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level.</li>
<li>I think there's a tremendous amount of tension in our society right
    now around spending and fiscal reform.  While I am in no way shape
    or form suggesting that Obama should become a shill for the Tea
    Party (god forbid!) I think he should take advantage of his second
    term presidency to make some hard decisions that will make hard
    liners on both sides cringe but are for the good of the country.</li>
<li>I think we need to take a long hard look at the war on terror and
    the erosion of our civil rights that's been happening in its name. 
    America is one of the greatest nations in the world and I would hate
    to see us lose such an important facet of our national identity in
    exchange for perceived safety.</li>
<li>He has made a big deal about support for equal marriage during this
    most recent campaign - let's see him put his money where his mouth
    is and enact reforms that would allow same-sex couples to travel to
    other states without fear (This is very tricky with regards to
    states rights, but I think it's important to get this right.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now.  Pardon the slightly rambling nature of these
bullets, I feel like each one could be a post in its own right.</p>                </article>

Like any civic minded person about to vote in tomorrow's MA senatorial
election tomorrow, I was browsing the candidates websites so I could
make an informed choice.

I am honestly not the biggest Coakley fan, but given the two choices
she's a shining star compared to Scott Brown ...</div>
