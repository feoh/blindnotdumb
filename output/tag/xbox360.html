</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I have suffered as much pain and heaped as much hatred in Redmond's
general direction as the next battle hardened veteran geek, but man,
this console is home entertainment done right.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Out of box hook up couldn't possibly be any easier. Plug the power
brick into the wall and the Xbox360, plug the HDMI cable into your TV,
plug the ethernet cable into your network and away you go. It's that
simple.</p>
<p>Network setup was beyond trivial - the unit set itself up properly
despite my somewhat complex home network configuration (I have a Linksys
and a Buffalo wifi router both running WDS, one doing NAT duties for the
house) and was talking to Xbox Live and downloading updates immediately.</p>
<p>I bought the Elite model, with the 120GB HD, so it comes with 'auto
download' turned on. I rather like this (Some would find it annoying I'm
sure) as it means that my console is pre-seeded with all the latest
demos so I can play all the hot new games to get an idea of what they're
like before buying.</p>
<p>And wow, the picture quality with this thing and a nice HD set is
impressive. I'm finding that video from the XB360 looks much better than
HD video from cable (I'm guessing this is a result of the compression I
keep hearing that cable companies like Comcast use.). I only have
Bioshock and Mass Effect thus far, and that they look amazing probably
goes without saying given the hype around them before and after their
release.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the XB360 experience I'm rather fond of are 'zones' -
your choices are Recreational, Family, Pro, and Underground. This means
that folks like me who are exceedingly unlikely to spend 22 hours
straight playing Halo to hone their attack skills aren't pitted against
people who haven't seen the sun in the last few years.</p>
<p>I was also surprised to see the depth and breadth of decidedly casual
games in the 'arcade' section, for people who eschew shooters and the
'temple of twitch' style of gaming.  Old board gaming standards like
Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, and Lost Cities are notable in their
presence, as well as a bunch of arcade classics I was pleased to see
being introduced to new generations of gamers (Like Gauntlet and Joust. 
Blue Valkyrie needs food badly! :)</p>
<p>Anyway, my gamer tag is 'forthewyn' in case anyone else out there has an
Xbox and cares to add me to their friend list.</p>                </article>
