&lt;a href="http://www.swype.com"&gt;Swype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tablets and smartphones first appeared on the scene, many of us
were so awash in the glow of our shiny new toys that we overlooked a
glaring weak point - text input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a stunning display of uncreative design, the keyboards for these
devices were simply 'virtualized' versions of their mechanical
counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result seems like a regular keyboard, but bereft of the comparative
elegance and efficiency of touch typing we are left in an incredibly
unsatisfying state of perpetual hunt and peck. To add insult to injury,
this ethereal target we're eternally stabbing at changes underneath us
to suit the whim of the author of whichever app we're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Swype, one simply glides one's finger from letter to letter
spelling our words. Swype handles tedious details like putting spaces
between words or after periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could keep babbling, but suffice it to say it has been a life changer
for me. Paired with &lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" title="Blogsy"&gt;Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;, my iPad
blogging ttyl of choice, you may be hearing from me more often!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having used the Chrome browser regularly for a couple of years now, I
really love quite a number of things about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The developer tools are superb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a vibrant user community, including a number of very smart
    people whose opinions I respect who are also huge fans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, its implementation under Mac OS X, my operating system of
choice, is rather flawed in a number of respects that drive me crazy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its external monitor support is awful.  If I have Chrome open on my
    Macbook Pro, then disconnect my external monitor and go to a
    meeting, all my windows have vanished into la-la land, and no amount
    of killing and restarting Chrome will bring them back.  Also,
    creating new windows fails silently as well, I presume Chrome thinks
    the windows are going to the external monitor which is no longer
    connected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No easy, native Java support! I know, I know, I can just about hear
    the hipster geeks rolling their eyes at this, but face it kiddos,
    Java was running mission critical systems while you were in diapers.
     It's not dead, it's not going away, and it's an incredibly useful
    tool - for Chrome on OS X to not natively support Java in the
    browser is unforgivable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unresponsive developers - Check out the Chromium bug list and you'll
    see droves of OS X users screaming for Java support - and dead
    silence from the developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet made the decision to switch back to Firefox full-time, but
they're certainly driving me in that direction.  I loved Firefox for
years until I fell in love with Chrome's speed, sleek design and awesome
devtools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2013 13:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-10-21:the-chrome-conundrum.html</guid><category>browsers</category><category>bugs</category><category>design</category><category>osx</category></item><item><title>I'm Glad Google Is Retiring Reader.</title><link>/im-glad-google-is-retiring-reader.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Because I and about a zillion other jilted Reader fans have now found
&lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedly is what Reader wanted to be when it grew up, but never had the
chance to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case anyone out there reading this is thinking "Google What?" -
here's the skinny.  If you find yourself reading a lot of websites on a
regular basis, constantly checking back to keep up to date with the
latest, you REALLY want a feed reader like this.  With something like
this, you can treat them all as if you were browsing articles in a
newspaper or magazine, either slavishly reading every one or, as I do,
cherry picking what most piques your interest from the stream (or
firehose as we geeks like to refer to it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I love about &lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com" title="Feedly"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard commands for everything - I'm a mouse hater from way back.
     Force me to click at your peril :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple views - I can either view my stream the good old fashioned
    way like Reader used to do - just a big old list of text headlines,
    or like a newspaper with photos front and center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 'Must Read' setting for the 1% of blogs I really don't want to
    miss a single post from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A truly superb mobile app! Can't overstate how important this is.
     The iPad and iPhone apps are optimized for that format, yet as
    feature-ful as the desktop.  Major win! (Reader sucked at this,
    using it on the go was paaaainful.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laziness - if you already use Reader as I did, all your feeds import
    seamlessly into Feedly, and while Reader still breathes, Feedly
    keeps it up to date so there's zero risk in giving it a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OK I know I already mentioned the mobile experience but the iPhone
    app deserves special mention, it makes it *so* easy to browse my
    feeds on the go, marking articles I actually want to read in-depth
    for later perusal via one of my other faves,
    &lt;a href="http://www.getpocket.com" title="Pocket"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Seriously, mad props
to the folks at &lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com" title="Feedly"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; for evolving
the state of the art, giving me a seamless migration path, and generally
taking an OK but generally pretty lackluster experience and elevating it
to joy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And no, I'm not being paid by these guys, I'm just wild about the
product.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2013 12:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-04-15:im-glad-google-is-retiring-reader.html</guid><category>articles</category><category>feedly</category><category>feeds</category><category>google</category><category>information</category><category>productivity</category><category>reader</category><category>rss</category></item><item><title>Ungagged!</title><link>/ungagged.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks back I was laid off from &lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com" title="Blue State Digital"&gt;Blue State
Digital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing but admiration for them and gratitude for three great
years during which I helped re-elect the first African-American
president, helped fight for equal marriage, and make the world a better
place by doing my usual job pushing bits around.  How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One upshot of this is that I'm no longer bound by the company's social
media policy.  I understand why it exists and even agree with it as far
as that goes.  When you're working for the president of the united
states, it's probably not so good if your minions start shooting their
mouths off about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news for me is that now I can say whatever I want :) Not that I
plan to go off half cocked and unleash raging venom on the world - I'm a
huge fan of the Obama administration and believe in a lot of what they
stand for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nobody's perfect, and neither is he or his administration. I will
write more about this as I collect my thoughts, but just off the top of
my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would love to see his administration take a hard-line stance on
    decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think there's a tremendous amount of tension in our society right
    now around spending and fiscal reform.  While I am in no way shape
    or form suggesting that Obama should become a shill for the Tea
    Party (god forbid!) I think he should take advantage of his second
    term presidency to make some hard decisions that will make hard
    liners on both sides cringe but are for the good of the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we need to take a long hard look at the war on terror and
    the erosion of our civil rights that's been happening in its name. 
    America is one of the greatest nations in the world and I would hate
    to see us lose such an important facet of our national identity in
    exchange for perceived safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has made a big deal about support for equal marriage during this
    most recent campaign - let's see him put his money where his mouth
    is and enact reforms that would allow same-sex couples to travel to
    other states without fear (This is very tricky with regards to
    states rights, but I think it's important to get this right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now.  Pardon the slightly rambling nature of these
bullets, I feel like each one could be a post in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 15:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-02-21:ungagged.html</guid><category>politics</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>I've gone native. (Or - Google's UI and I are parting ways)</title><link>/ive-gone-native-or-googles-ui-and-i-are-parting-ways.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today Google
&lt;a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/introducing-new-compose-in-gmail.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that
they were releasing a new Composer for GMail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's awful.  They made the window small, and right justified it.  I feel
like I have to crane my neck at an unnatural angle in order to see what
I'm writing, and worse yet, they've turned my good old message
composition interface into something akin to a web forum or chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; what I'm looking for in my email user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, Google also did a full on revamp of the GMail UI that
utterly convinced me they have an unrelenting hatred of the visually
impaired. The entire screen looked as if it had been bleached of color
and life, and the contrast was so low I could literally barely read it
at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After squeals of protect from a large chunk of their user base, they
relented and produced a 'high contrast' setting, which was better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I can't keep feeling like I'm being punched full in the face
by Google every few months. I respect their right to innovate their
products in whatever way they see fit, but thankfully I don't have to
choose between liking it or hitting the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've switched to Apple's Mail.app and iCal. They work great, aren't
actively hostile to the visually impaired, and allow me to keep using
the Google back end so I can keep my old email addresses and contact
info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple may be many things, but one thing they are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about is
providing accessibility features for the handicapped. It's not like I
have any illusions about being a minority - most people can probably
read the ghostly low contrast color theme just fine, and probably like
the fact that their email now looks more like IM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More power to them I say :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:  Can't lie, it's been a rough go.  Gmail's IMAP access
throttles throughput beyond a certain point, and Apple Mail can't handle
the large mailboxes I have even with having given them a serious slim
down.  I really wish there were a solution to this problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update Update: I've essentially given up on this :( Mail.app just plain
stinks.  It might be fine for folks with a single account or maybe very
light usage on multiple accounts, but with two Gmail accounts and lots
of labels, it's downright abysmal.  It takes 15-20 minutes to get
everything in sync, and then often takes another 20 minutes just to
&lt;strong&gt;exit the app!&lt;/strong&gt; This is not my idea of an enterprise class  eMail
application.  I'm disappointed in you Apple!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2012 17:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2012-10-31:ive-gone-native-or-googles-ui-and-i-are-parting-ways.html</guid><category>email</category><category>google</category><category>handicapped</category><category>Macintosh</category><category>mail</category><category>UX</category></item><item><title>What This Election Means To Me</title><link>/what-this-election-means-to-me.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For me, this election is personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a candidate and the party that backs him set out to legislate what
goes on in the bedroom (telling us who to love and marry) and in the
doctor's office (making decisions about my reproductive health and that
of my wife) it's an affront to me and every like minded American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitt Romney has vowed to do everything in his power to repeal Roe V.
Wade. I do not understand even from a common sense perspective as a
reasonable adult how this makes any sense. How will returning to an era
where women lived in fear and abortions were grisly deeds performed in
back alleys with coat hangers benefit the American people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Catholic acquaintances who speak of advocating for the baby, yet
they leave out the bit where all these children are carried to term and
brought into a life lived in squalid conditions and being cared for by
people who are neither capable nor willing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the issue of marriage. I find the mere idea that an
aspirant to rule would attempt to dictate the gender of the person I
choose to take as my life partner repugnant and offensive to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my best friends in this world are gay. In fact, one of them
actually performed the marriage ceremony for my wife and I. Just
thinking about the fact that Mr. Romney would try to sever the holy
bonds of matrimony that he shares with his husband makes me &lt;strong&gt;angry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my ideal world, government would not be in the business of marriage
at all, but that isn't the world we live in today. I applaud the Obama
campaign for having had the courage to stand up and say "This isn't
right. Let's fix it.". The naysayers will be quick to point out that
this change in attitude was politically motivated, and maybe it was, but
really? Who cares? That makes it no less right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been hearing a lot of unhappy people of late expressing
dissatisfaction with president Obama and his administration,
particularly around jobs and the economy. To my mind, he inherited some
of the worst economic conditions of any incoming president in the
history of our nation, and while many would dispute this point I feel
very strongly that the president has done and will continue to do a bang
up job making the best of this awful mess the last 8 years of Republican
rule have left us in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy aside for a moment, I am proud to be doing my part to give the
president the time he needs to get the job done. This isn't about
politics for me, it's about fighting the good fight because it's the
right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2012 13:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2012-09-15:what-this-election-means-to-me.html</guid><category>administration</category><category>democratic</category><category>election</category><category>president</category></item><item><title>The walled garden is the future of computing.</title><link>/the-walled-garden-is-the-future-of-computing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;These days it seems like almost everybody (at least almost everybody in
the technology world) has made bashing Apple their new favorite past
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the complaints I hear again and again is that Apple's
mobile operating system that runs every iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch are
designed based on the "walled garden" philosophy - meaning that you can
only install approved apps on the device from Apple's App Store unless
you throw all caution (and your warranty :)) and jailbreak your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to Google's Android OS where the user can install anything
they want, from wherever they want from wherever they want, including
some fairly insidious malware. I know I've been spammed two or three
times by friends who had their Android phone's address book compromised.
However even Google is making moves in more restrictive directions of
late, but only in their app store, which you can ignore completely if
you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these geeks are missing is that for 99% of the population, the jail
is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a good thing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;People want their devices to be appliances&lt;/em&gt;.
They want to browse the web without fear, write their documents and
spreadsheets unfettered by things like virus checking, file systems and
storage devices, and play their games secure in the knowledge that
they're not pulling in a Trojan that will send Nazi supremacist hate
mail to their grandma and their boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard truth for many geeks to accept is that for end users, this
represents pretty much the ideal computing experience. This goes way
beyond Apple and iDevices and into the realm of general purpose
computers like laptops mad desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All one need do is examine the marketing blurbs for the latest OS
versions from Apple and Microsoft to validate my claim. Windows 8
features required code signing for installed apps, effectively the
beginnings of a walled garden of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned previously, Apple lead the charge into the walled garden
future I'm predicting with IOS, but with tithe release of MacOS X
Mountain Lion, they're filing the rough edges from the computing
experience for desktop and laptop users as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly it's been rather amusing to,watch the geek-o-sphere practically
tremble with rage over this issue, ranting and roaring on about Apple's
new found tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth I just don't get it. Gatekeeper can be bypassed with a single
key press. What's the big deal? I predict that there will always
continue to be trap doors and escape hatches for those who know enough
to seek them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is in fact not trying to impose some kind of Orwellian new world
order and declaring a Jihad on geeks, they're just doing what they've
always done, innovating the tech in ways that will improve the quality
of life for the majority of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, geeks need to get over themselves. Computing has become such
a part of the mainstream of every day life that people don't &lt;strong&gt;want or
need&lt;/strong&gt; to be beholden to the techno-priesthood any longer. To my mind,
this is nothing but win. Over the long haul, it means we can get out of
the business of being family tech support, and get back to playing with
technology and having fun pushing the envelope!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2012 21:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2012-08-15:the-walled-garden-is-the-future-of-computing.html</guid><category>apple</category><category>code</category><category>computers</category><category>cryptography</category><category>future</category><category>signing</category></item><item><title>Trying out VimRepress</title><link>/trying-out-vimrepress.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;VimRePress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing effort to immerse myself in Vim as much as possible, I'm
trying out a plugin called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimRepress"&gt;VimRepress&lt;/a&gt; - a fork of the
popular Vimpress plugin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, getting it running with MacVim on MacOS X Lion is a bit
of a bear, but thankfully Paulo Poiati wrote an excellent
&lt;a href="http://blog.paulopoiati.com/2012/02/07/installing-vimrepress-in-macvim-osx-lion/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
on getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you're using Homebrew, you have to rebuild your MacVim to
use the i386 architecture, otherwise you wind up with a Python
interpreter that doesn't match the bitness of your editor, and when
MacVim goes to invoke Python to run the blogging bits in the plugin,
MacVim explodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also unfortunately, you can't use the Homebrew built Python or Ruby
interpreters when building MacVim either, and have to instead use the
bundled ones from MacOS (both sorely out of date. Who uses Ruby 1.8
anymore? :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to uninstall my Homebrew based Python and Ruby, install
python-markdown2 into the OSX default Python instance, and now
everything seems to be working just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living the Vim Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VimRepress and Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are still some creature comforts that I miss from the
awesome Blogging bundle in TextMate - silly things like giving me a drop
down list with the possible Categories for my post and the like.
Hopefully over time we can get those implemented in Vim land :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside, and this counts for a lot, is that I can now write in
&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; again
\&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;contented sigh&lt;/em&gt;&gt; I've missed Markdown terribly ever since I
transitioned the blog from Typo to Wordpress many moons ago. It's a joy
to write in, and really lets me think about the writing, not about a
properly formed HTML element, which is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vim and Me In the Large&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, thus far the minor pain of transitioning to Vim has
been entirely worth it, I've definitely seen a noticeable productivity
boost, and for work-a-day code and configuration editing, I'm actually
finding Vim to be vastly more powerful than TextMate simply because my
environment is everywhere I want to be rather than being chained to
using my Mac desktop for editing and resorting to chicanery like remote
mounted filesystems via sshfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I'd read &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer"&gt;The Pragmatic
Programmer&lt;/a&gt; with its
mantra of "Learn &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; editor, and learn it *&lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;" (paraphrase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always had mixed feelings about that. I'd taken pride through most of
my career in being able to learn a multitude of different tools and
adapt to whatever worked best in the local environment. That is in fact
a really great skill to have, but there is definitely wisdom where
editors are concerned to pick one and &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; in it 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/"&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; has helped tremendously with
that. With it you can have your cake and eat it to. You can use the very
same config files and plugins you use on your UNIX servers on your
desktop, only wrapped in a superbly crafted Aqua GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a continuing process, but thus far the work I've put in has been
totally worth it. I would encourage anyone who's on the fence to give it
a try and be strict with yourself about it. Pick a time when you can
afford to take the hit and spend the time to get facile enough that you
won't miss your old environment. You won't regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

ago, and if one can believe what one reads, they did so for the sole
purpose of killing it.  This is a stupid move on their part if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own both an iPad and a Kindle, I use and love both for different
things, and in my opinion they're apples and oranges.  Reading technical
books on Kindle is quite frankly an awful experience.  The translations
of many of them into Mobipocket format are abysmal.  Sidebars are
mangled into poorly formatted blobs of text separated from the main body
by a vertical bar if you're lucky, or maybe a different typeface if
you're not.  Lines are slung together, and pagination is utter hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this isn't entirely Amazon's fault.  The Mobipocket format
is simple to be sure, but if enough care is spent it's quite possible to
produce eminently acceptable results, but as I say, it requires
&lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt;, which is something most publishers seemingly aren't willing to
provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reading prose, in my humble opinion, nothing beats the experience of
an E-ink Kindle.  They're easy on the eyes, and with many models you get
free Whispernet book downloads.  Awesome.  Even when I'm using my iPad,
I still do 99% of my 'fun' reading with the Amazon Kindle app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I'll be the first to admit that business is war and taking out
what could be seen as a direct rival is a smart move in one sense, in
reality the consumer gets punished, and consumers rarely react well to
such treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will not turn to Amazon because their beloved Stanza has exploded
in a fiery ball of doom with the coming of IOS 5, they'll simply turn to
other alternatives like the excellent
&lt;a href="http://www.megareader.net/"&gt;MegaReader&lt;/a&gt; application whose author is
working very hard to cater to the Stanza users bereft of their favorite
reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumb move, Amazon.  I am still a loyal fan, and this won't in any way
change how much I buy from you, but I am decidedly &lt;strong&gt;not pleased.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2011-11-01:amazon-is-doing-itself-a-dis-service-by-killing-stanza.html</guid></item><item><title>Move over TextMate. MacVim is the new kid in town!</title><link>/move-over-textmate-macvim-is-the-new-kid-in-town.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For years I've been rather proud of the fact that I'm a total polyglot
when it&lt;br /&gt;
comes to editors. I'm comfortable on both sides of the fence, using
Emacs, Vi,&lt;br /&gt;
TextMate, EditPlus, or even the venerable /bin/ed whenever that makes
sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But for the first time in a long time, my current (awesome! :)) job at
&lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com"&gt;Blue&lt;br /&gt;
State Digital&lt;/a&gt; has given me the
opportunity to&lt;br /&gt;
branch out and do quite a bit of real software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered TextMate shortly after I came to OSX. It's a great
editor,&lt;br /&gt;
and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Alan Odegard of
&lt;a href="http://www.macromates.com"&gt;Macromates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
software. He has just about single handedly created not only an
amazing&lt;br /&gt;
editor, but a vibrant and loyal community around his program, and he's
to be&lt;br /&gt;
commended for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have remained happy in TextMate land, but for the fact that my
most&lt;br /&gt;
recent job has me going back to where it all started for me - server
side UNIX,&lt;br /&gt;
Linux to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I editing files on my Mac using Expandrive to remotely mount them,
but&lt;br /&gt;
quite frankly that's a pain in the neck I just don't need to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Vim, I can memorize one set of keystrokes for everywhere I might
need to&lt;br /&gt;
be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with MacVim, I get a nicely streamlined, beautifully Aqua-fied
interface,&lt;br /&gt;
with all the creature comforts TextMate provides and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, there are a number of folks making the same transition, so
there&lt;br /&gt;
are some excellent articles and websites out there to ease the
transition like&lt;br /&gt;
[this guide on making the  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;switch](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/09/05/textmate-to-vim.html#masthead)
or&lt;br /&gt;
the excellent &lt;a href="http://vimcasts.org"&gt;VimCasts&lt;/a&gt; series of Vim tutorial
screen&lt;br /&gt;
casts. They cover everything from the basics to some fairly advanced
tips and&lt;br /&gt;
tricks on more complex Vim modes and integrations, and is written by a
TextMate&lt;br /&gt;
to Vim switcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm writing this post on the excellent&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3510"&gt;VimRePress&lt;/a&gt;
plugin for&lt;br /&gt;
Vim that allows you to author and manage your Wordpress blog right from
within&lt;br /&gt;
the editor! Very sweet :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's a brave new world, and I'm excited by the opportunity to get&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good at Vim so I can push my editing productivity through
the roof&lt;br /&gt;
:)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 17:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2011-09-09:move-over-textmate-macvim-is-the-new-kid-in-town.html</guid><category>editors</category><category>Mac</category><category>platforms</category><category>textmate</category><category>UNIX</category><category>vim</category></item><item><title>Sleeeepy (And old :P)</title><link>/sleeeepy-and-old-p.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that as I get older, getting enough good sleep has become
more and more of an issue...&lt;!--more--&gt;As I get older, I find my need
for sleep decidedly increasing. Not so much the amount of sleep, that
has remained relatively stagnant at around 6 hours minimum (with a
minimum of 1 or 2 8+ hour nights thrown in for good measure) but the
degree to which the lack of the required sleep effects me and my ability
to do my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I could pull two or three all nighters in a week
with virtually no ill effects. Now, a night with 4 or 5 hours sleep, or
a night where my sleep is disturbed by something or other has a real and
noticeable effect on me the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know all the excess weight I'm carrying around isn't helping, and
hence I've been exercising religiously, burning about 300 calories per
session, which has definitely begun making a dent in my overall weight
(I won't mention numbers yet for fear of jinxing it. I find it's best
not to talk progress until I've lost a truly significant amount of and
kept it off for a while.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a treadmill and an exercise bike about 6 months ago now, and
those have been invaluable. The ability to exercise at home at my own
convenience means I can stumble out of bed, down the stairs, and onto
the treadmill so that before I ever have the chance to talk myself out
of it, I'm on the treadmill or the bike chugging away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thankfully things are moving in a positive direction. I just have to
keep at it, not fall off the horse (again having the equipment in the
house eliminates a myriad of excuses!) and be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's heartening for me to see a bunch of the younger folks I work with
decidedly not falling into the same trap many geeky people from my
generation were bitten by. They're incredibly health conscious, and
pretty much all have incredibly rigorous work out regimens and are
scrupulous about tracking their weight (One guy has his bathroom scale
broadcast his current weight to his Twitter feed. Think I'll pass on
that one, thanks :)). I know we've all heard the saw about establishing
good habits early, but in this case it can't be emphasized enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, pardon the slightly unfocused ramble, but this stuff has been
rattling around my head wanting to be written for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone's enjoying their summer!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2011-07-18:sleeeepy-and-old-p.html</guid><category>aging</category><category>career</category><category>exercise</category><category>health</category><category>sleep</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>Why Apple's Mac App Store will be good for the Mac</title><link>/why-apples-mac-app-store-will-be-good-for-the-mac.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When Apple said they were introducing an "App Store" to OSX a-la the
iPhone, iPad, etc. there was much ranting and foaming at the
mouth...&lt;!--more--&gt;Many geeks proclaimed the death of Mac OS X as we
know it. "Apple is iPhone-izing the Mac!" they cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're largely wrong, at least in all the important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the salient points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovery - people are *far* more likely to purchase things that
    are available from a single, readily accessible source. Having a
    veritable floatilla of awesome software that's discoverable right
    from the Apple menu of every Mac means that if you're a publisher,
    people are FAR more likely to try your software. I myself found a
    free copy of Autodesk Sketchpad in the app store that I am very much
    enjoying. I might end up buying the commercial product as a result -
    possibly through the app store! (See caveats below for why I might
    choose the shrink wrapped version.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of installation - just like on the iPhone and iPad, you click
    "Buy" or "Install" and *BOOM* it's on your machine, happily
    bouncing in your dock. For non technical people, this is a godsend.
    They do not want to know about .dmg files, dragging apps to the
    Applications folder, or the like. Yes, I know, this is VASTLY easier
    than the folks in the Windows world have it with their highly
    complex installers, but even still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One Stop Shopping for updates - Sure, lots of devs these days are
    bundling some kind of update mechanism into their apps, but this is
    once again - seamless and easy to use for non technical people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, every silver lining has a cloud attached, so there are a few
down sides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflexible upgrade path - Apple has imposed rules around publishers
    app store offerings, I don't know all the details, but I do know
    that publishers are not happy. They want total control of how they
    monetize the sale of upgrades for their customers, and to a certain
    extent I can't blame them. Over all I think the net winner here is
    the consumer, so we'll see how many publishers sign up and
    grudgingly cope with the new rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrictive rules about permitted content - Nothing sexy, nothing
    violent, no Java or Rosetta, just like the IOS app store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, people who object to the app store on OSX are on
shaky ground, because unlike the IOS world where the app store is the
ONLY way to get apps, the app store on OSX isn't. You can still install
apps the old fashioned way, and Apple has given &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; indocation that
they intend to do this now or at any time in the future. I don't think
it's in their best interest to do this, and I think people who are
predicting imminent doom really need to get their collective head
checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, geeks do have a propensity for hysterics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, I think everyone (publishers, consumers, and the wider Mac
community) has everything to gain and nothing to lose from the app
store, and I for one welcome the addition.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2011 14:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2011-06-21:why-apples-mac-app-store-will-be-good-for-the-mac.html</guid><category>app</category><category>apple</category><category>geeks</category><category>ios</category><category>Macintosh</category><category>macos</category><category>osx</category><category>rants</category><category>store</category></item><item><title>Don't buy early access (MEAP) books from Manning Press.</title><link>/dont-buy-early-access-meap-books-from-manning-press.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to write a negative blog post about a tech publisher's ebooks
program, but I'm afraid they've driven me to it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[May 2011 Update: Manning has changed things and you can now download
any books you've ever bought from them anytime. Yay! My other criticisms
still stand, but this is an improvement!]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly, easily half of the MEAP titles I've purchased never make it to
publication, after languishing for months and months while I get E-mails
about the authors being hard at work on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I don't sympathize, writing a book is from what I understand
Really Hard, but as a consumer if I've signed up to buy something, I
expect a completed product to come out the other end. To be fair,
Manning does offer either a refund or an exchange plus a bonus free
e-book, but most of the truly hot topics that I found interesting were
MEAP books again, so the cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Manning uses the Yahoo Store for their ebook delivery. Wow,
what a nightmare. You get n days to download your book once they send
you the email, and then POOOF your purchase goes off into the ether.
Compare and contrast with &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/" title="O'Reilly Media - Technology Books, Tech Conferences, IT Courses, News"&gt;O'Reilly and
Associates&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/" title="The Pragmatic Bookshelf"&gt;Pragmatic
Programmers&lt;/a&gt; (two
publishing houses I can't recommend enthusiastically enough.) where you
can re-download your purchases anytime, for *life*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you buy early access titles from either of these publishers, you are
not chained to your email for fear that the ticking time bomb of your
download notice will expire when you're not looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I think Manning really needs to take a long, hard look at
its store front user experience. I'm not saying I'll never buy a title
from them again, but I am saying it's a HECK of a lot less likely that I
will, and I'll always choose pragprog or O'Reilly if I have a choice..&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2011 09:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2011-02-27:dont-buy-early-access-meap-books-from-manning-press.html</guid><category>customer service</category><category>early access</category><category>ebooks</category><category>manning</category><category>meap</category><category>publishing</category><category>technical</category></item><item><title>Why Many Hard Core Science Fiction / Fantasy Fans Hate Harry Potter</title><link>/why-hard-core-science-fiction-fantasy-fans-hate-harry-potter.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, I finally did it. After a nearly non stop marathon reading of the
last three books in the series (I wanted to read all the books before I
saw the movies, and I'm very glad I did this. As always, the books have
&lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more depth.), I've come to the following conclusions...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hard core science fiction and fantasy fans dislike the series,
quite simply, because it's not written for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to quite like the series, but in order to enjoy it as I have I
found it necessary to keep my fanboy hat firmly in its place the entire
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could poke a thousand holes in the series, but what it all comes down
to is this - it's a totally whimsical universe, devoid of the kind of
carefully construed logical frameworks that hard core fantasy and scifi
fans clamor for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at magic just as a for instance. In the Potter-verse,
spells are formulaic incantations that produce ambiguous results.
Compare and contrast this with something like Jim Butcher's Dresden
files, where things like the laws of physics come heavily into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Harry Potter series isn't primarily about magic,
although wizards and witches fill the pages of the book, it's about good
(Harry) in the never ending struggle against evil, and the terrible
price that those who stand up against evil must pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion though, it's a heck of a ride. Very entertaining
from start to finish, and in the end analysis couldn't all of us do with
a bit of an escape into whimsy once in a while anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at first blush the series appears to be young adult reading, good
only for kids too young to be exposed to the evils of the world, and the
first books are indeed very light hearted and very much fairy tale like
in nature, but as the series progresses it becomes much, &lt;em&gt;MUCH&lt;/em&gt; darker.
Evil and its outcome is depicted in much sharper contrast, and death
looms around every corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage any hard core fantasy fan who read the first book,
said "meh" and walked away to give it another try. Look at it from a
different perspective, and just try to enjoy the story for what it is.
In the end I predict you will not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2010 11:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-12-08:why-hard-core-science-fiction-fantasy-fans-hate-harry-potter.html</guid><category>analysis</category><category>books</category><category>fans</category><category>fantasy</category><category>fiction</category><category>magic</category><category>stories</category><category>wands</category><category>wizards</category></item><item><title>Managing crontabs with Git</title><link>/managing-crontabs-with-git.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;April 2012 Update&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span
style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;Nowadays we use &lt;a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/" title="Chef"&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #ff0000;"&gt;Chef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
from Opscode solutions to manage our crontabs, and just about everything
else in our enterprise infrastructure. It rocks :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and time again over the years I've dealt with the same problem -
who took a random pot shot at some critical user's crontab file and
deleted things without asking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, someone realizes that some function that's supposed to
run every so often has stopped, and in fact hasn't run in weeks. You
sniff around - nope, no errors in the logs, in fact no logs at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you look at the crontab for the user in question and realize that
the lines invoking the script that used to be there have either been
deleted or commented out. What the? Who did this, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git to the rescue! With the help of a simple Bourne Shell script, you
can keep your crontab managed so you'll not just be able to see who
changed what and when, but if you have the Git hook installed to send
mail on commits, you can be notified of those changes in real time.
Pretty cool eh? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since crontab has no built in security precautions other than requiring
you to BE the user whose crontab you're submitting, we can't lock people
not using this script out, but if you tell everyone that changes they
make outside of the script may be summarily ignored and overwritten (and
put something to that effect in the comment block at the top of your
crontab) you should be in good shape. The script will compare what's in
Git with what's currently installed in cron, and if there are
discrepancies it will give you a chance to cleanly exit and resolve
them, or allow you to ignore them and roll forward with editing and
submitting what's in Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the script. It assumes you're running as your regular user and
have sudo privs to the user whose crontab you wish to edit. It also
assumes you've created a Git repository called system_cron.git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set it up, just edit reponame and gitrepo to appropriate values for
your site and copy the script to somewhere folks can access it in their
PATH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it, just invoke it with the user whose crontab you want to edit -
for example:&lt;code&gt;edit_crontab.sh build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``` {lang="bash"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/sh&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;export tmpdir="/tmp/crontab_$$"&lt;/p&gt;

back...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have noticed over time is that nothing leaves me relaxed in
quite the same way as a vacation to Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it has to do with more than just the majestic green mountain
views, fresh air, and locally sourced fresh food. It's a state of mind,
one which embraces an aesthetic that pervades everything and is a
conscious decision on the part of its participants to build in ways that
harmonize with the natural landscape rather than paving over and
obliterating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, we visited the &lt;a href="http://www.woodstockmagazineonline.com/2010/09/woodstock-apples-crafts-fair/" title="Woodstock Apples &amp;amp; Crafts Fair | Woodstock Magazine"&gt;Woodstock Apple and Crafts
Fair&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="http://www.craftproducers.com/festival-details.php?id=31" title="Craft Producers"&gt;Stowe Foliage Arts
Festival&lt;/a&gt;.
The artisans displaying their wares were really quite amazing. This is
not your average New England craft show with 9000 booths of knit
scarves. These festivals had woodworoking, blown and stained glass,
metal smiths, leatherworkers, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No trip to Vermont (for us anyway :) would be complete without a stop at
&lt;a href="http://www.alchemistbeer.com/" title="The Alchemist Pub And Brewery"&gt;The
Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;
in Waterbury. These folks have some of the best craft brewed beer I've
ever tasted. This time I got to sample their new 'Wee Heavy' - a super
malty dark brew called 'The Wee Little Wabbit' - yum! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about retiring there in our dottage, and I've got to say
I'm definitely up for it. Hopefully we can retire young enough to be
able to actually enjoy it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2010 17:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-10-14:green-mountains-on-my-mind.html</guid><category>artisans</category><category>arts</category><category>beer</category><category>crafts</category><category>fairs</category><category>food</category><category>green mountains</category><category>mountains</category><category>outdoors</category><category>scenery</category><category>travel</category><category>trees</category><category>vacation</category><category>Vermont</category><category>woods</category></item><item><title>Will Java survive Oracle?</title><link>/untitled.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When Oracle bought Sun, I was initially fairly bullish on the idea - I
thought Oracle might temper some of Sun's whimsical brainstorming turned
projects that it poured resources into, and create a leaner, meaner Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if initial indications continue to hold, they may be going too
far, and throwing the baby out with the bath water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard from several people who returned from JavaOne about what a
disappointing experience it was, and how they felt marginalized and
overrun by the suit wearing denizens that have populated Oracle Develop
for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't surprised when I heard that Oracle was folding JavaOne into its
main conference offering, but I *WAS* surprised that they didn't take
great pains to ensure that the experience for Java developers was no
less useful, fun and all around worth it to developers as it has been in
the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would think they'd be working overtime to convince developers that
Java is still a first class, thriving platform worth investing in, not
an also ran to Oracle's existing product suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I'm observing from a slight distance these days as I work
for &lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/"&gt;Blue State Digital&lt;/a&gt;, an
incredible company doing amazing things with PHP (which has come a long,
LONG way while I wasn't looking - I'll be posting about that soon), but
I still feel like I have a lot invested in Java - I spent a decade out
of my career living in that space, so I would love to see it continue to
thrive, not just survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Java isn't going away any time soon. In my opinion it's a great
platform (not free of warts, sure, but name one that is) but this does
make me wonder about people choosing a platform for new projects - there
are lots of choices out there today, many of which are lighter weight
and much less fragmented than what Java has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle needs to make up its mind about whether it sees Java as a crown
jewel or a sick aunt to be locked away in a drafty room and checked on
once every few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it already has, only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2010 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-10-06:untitled.html</guid><category>acquisition</category><category>community</category><category>development</category><category>Java</category><category>JavaOne</category><category>Oracle</category><category>Sun</category><category>support</category><category>technology</category></item><item><title>Face, meet Mr. Concrete wall.</title><link>/face-meet-mr-concrete-wall.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned here previously, my last big job search after I got laid
off from MIT was decidedly Not Fun...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up taking a job I would normally never take, because I felt
utterly backed up against a wall by the economy, increasing competition
in the tech sector, and the big skeleton rattling around in my closet -
the lack of a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got turned down by 2 or 3 prospective employers because of this, which
is something that hasn't happened to me for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I took said job, I steeled myself for the worst and called my
old school, Worcester State College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was not at all what I was expecting. I &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; only need
two courses to get my bachelors degree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got all the paperwork filled out, jumped through all the necessary
hoops and found out that I (still) need a science, and a science with a
lab in order to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That information in hand, I went casting around for a science course I
could take. Not easy, many of them required calculus, and those that
didn't hab lab periods smack dab in the middle of my work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one course, Astronomy, that only claimed to require College
Algebra and was taught Tuesday and Thursday evenings. So, I leapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course started a week and a half ago. Since that time, I have poured
\~30 hours and a number of sleepless nights into it, and unfortunately I
have to admit that there is eactly zero chance of my passing this
course. No amount of effort, lack of sleep, or heroics short of quitting
my job (Freaking unlikely since I'm INCREDIBLY happy where I am now. I
escaped from Windows enterprise hell and am working for an amazing
company, &lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/"&gt;Blue State Digital&lt;/a&gt;.) will
save me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been expecting the math to kick my ass, but in the end analyais, I
could handle that just fine! There wasn't a single bit of algebraic
manipulation I couldn't get past with a little work and some Google
thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the formulas! Crazy, INSANE formulas crawling across the page and
eating my poor addled brain like some kind of scene out of Dawn of the
Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F~ev~ / F~em~ = ( G M~v~ M~e~ / R~ev~^2^ ) / ( G M~m~ M~e~ / R~em~^2^)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to withdraw from the battlefiend this time - I've lost the
skirmish, but I am bound and determined to win the war!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take some time to recover, take a fresh look at the problem, and
talk to my academic advisor to see if I can apply some 'life credit' or
something, or at the very least not bludgeon myself senseless over my
lack of higher math, so I can finish up the silly degree and get on with
my life!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2010 15:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-06-29:face-meet-mr-concrete-wall.html</guid><category>astronomy</category><category>career</category><category>courses</category><category>degree</category><category>goals</category><category>life</category><category>math</category><category>science</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>Yay and Boo all in one breath: The Amazon Kindle Development Kit (KDK)</title><link>/yay-and-boo-all-in-one-breath-the-amazon-kindle-development-kit-kdk.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon has finally come out with the details around their Kindle
Development Kit (KDK) you can read the details
&lt;a href="https://kindlepublishing.amazon.com/gp/vendor/kindlepubs/kdk/get-content?id=200436000"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely great news for the J2ME development community, this
is a mainstream device from a big name manufacturer where they can ply
their existing skill set or port their existing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm a bit disappointed. I realize that the Kindle is meant as a
light weight device, but I have always found J2ME's I/O model to be
rather cripplingly baroque in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over Amazon's APIDoc however, it does seem like they've built
their own infrastructure atop J2ME, so perhaps they've made it easier
and more pleasant to code for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm torn between wanting to get in on the ground floor and not wanting
to invest the time and energy in learning a technology (J2ME) which I
feel has gone way past its expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we'll see but I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on this
one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2010 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-02-07:yay-and-boo-all-in-one-breath-the-amazon-kindle-development-kit-kdk.html</guid><category>amazon</category><category>development</category><category>j2me</category><category>Java</category><category>kindle</category><category>programming</category></item><item><title>Twitter is not Facebook, let's keep it that way.</title><link>/twitter-is-not-facebook-lets-keep-it-that-way.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying Twitter for quite a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the blather out there about it being a self indulgent waste
of time, I think it's become pretty clear to anyone open minded enough
to actually wake up and smell the coffee that it's a communications
medium like any other, but one that lends itself to the dynamic, fast
paced nature of the modern world we live in. I personally find Twitter
useful on a number of levels, but first and foremost as a tool for the
dispersal of technical information to interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance I follow Guillaume Laforge, one of the designers of the
&lt;a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" title="The Groovy Programming Language"&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt;
programming language to see what's up with new releases of his software,
what he's up to, etc. I'm also following a number of members of the
&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/" title="Windows PowerShell"&gt;Windows
PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;
development team at Microsoft to get the inside scoop on that awesome
tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also follow Amanda Palmer, lead vocalist for The Dresden Dolls,
several authors, and a smattering of friends who've also been turned on
to Twitter, as well as some feeds around hobbies and interests of mine -
the &lt;a href="http://blog.paintermagazine.co.uk/" title="Corel Painter"&gt;Corel Painter&lt;/a&gt;
community has an incredibly vibrant Twitter presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that Twitter may have originally been about what people
are eating for lunch today, or that the train is late in coming and
they're stuck next to a guy who smells on the platform, but like most
things it has evolved and become something much more than the designers
originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this rather useful convention in the Twitter world called &lt;a href="http://tagdef.com/" title="hash tag definitions"&gt;hash
tags&lt;/a&gt; - things like
#powershell or #groovy or #redsox - these let people with particular
interests 'tune in' on related tweets whether or not they're already
following a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last week however I've begun to see a trend I really do not like.
Tags like &lt;a href="http://playspymaster.com/" title="Spymaster"&gt;#spymaster&lt;/a&gt; are being
used by people playing games that use Twitter and your followers as the
medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clutters up my Twitter feed, but more to the point, makes Twitter
much less usable and interesting for those who don't have and/or don't
want to &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; fancy clients that can filter out certain tags so they
won't be bothered by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, it's been a fantastic way
for me to get back in touch with a bunch of people I am really psyched
to be in contact with again, but as anyone with a lot of Facebook
friends and not a lot of time knows, the silly games and apps can get
quite chatty and &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; annoying awfully quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying anyone's doing anything wrong here - some of the apps are
fun and a couple are even useful or enlightening, but when you log in
and see 120 Little Green Plant requests, 50 Snowball requests, 40 Mixed
Drink requests, and 300 'Other' requests, it gets real old, real fast :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's my take on the matter. Let's keep Twitter as much signal as we
can, lest the noise overtake us and leave us drowning in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;

I apologize for the
fade, my 4 or 5 readers must be thinking I'd joined the silent masses of
bloggers who can't overcome the inertia and fail to post ever again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chinatown Gate
Small" src="http://www.feoh.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/chinatown-gate-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I described in my last post, January was not the best of months for
me, and neither was February for that matter. After the layoff, I
launched into the job search with zeal and quickly remembered (It's like
riding the bike :) the familiar rhythms of the horse and pony show that
is any job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely work to be had out there, but much of it was well
outside the city, only barely accessible via a bus line that dropped me
into the middle of a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; pedestrian unfriendly industrial park.
Eek. I interviewed a lot, and even had a close call at MIT but in the
end analysis they had further cuts and couldn't hire for the job for
another month or so which put me out of the running - I have a hungry
mortgage to feed after all :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, a recruiter from a company I'd never heard of before - &lt;a href="http://www.trizetto.com/" title="The Trizetto Group"&gt;The
Trizetto Group&lt;/a&gt; called
and said they were very interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're a Windows shop, which initially made me shy away from the idea,
but they do a LOT of Perl for their core process automation stuff which
I'm reasonably fluent in, and it would be an opportunity for a total
technology reboot - not something one gets a lot of chances to do in
one's career. So I interviewed there a couple of times and it worked
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, it's been really great. They're right across from the
Chinatown gate in the picture above, so I can just hop on the bus
outside my door for a short ride to Sullivan Station T, then another
reasonably short subway ride to the Chinatown stop on the Orange Line.
I've been enjoying the chance to explore Chinatown more fully. Where
else can you stop off at the market next door before work and grab a can
of white fungus drink, or some dried cuttlefish snack? (Why you would
&lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to is a different matter altogether, though I do enjoy the
cuttlefish :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work has been exciting and challenging as well. I was really,
&lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; out of touch with the modern Windows environment. My last
real experience working in depth with it was back in the Windows NT 4.0
and Windows 98 era and it has come a long, &lt;strong&gt;LONG&lt;/strong&gt; way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hours have been long at times (I joined toward the end of a release
cycle and it's a major crunch) but I've been learning a &lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; about
Installshield, .Net, ASP.Net, Powershell, the registry, and in general
the vagaries of working in the Windows environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting that everyone should ditch the comfort of their Linux
or Mac environments. Heck, if I had my druthers I'd be hacking on one of
those for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, many geeks (and I was very much guilty of this) have
institutionalized the hatred of all things Microsoft, and in so doing
have had their heads in the sand for so long that they've failed to
notice a truly powerful environment evolving out of the muck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get off my soapbox now. I guess that's about it - life is generally
pretty good. There are times when I wish I could be spending time with
my lovely wife or my friends, but I'd rather deal with that than the
alternative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I'll have something of substance to say again soon. Stay
tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2009 19:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2009-06-12:so-i-landed-in-china-town.html</guid><category>boston</category><category>Chinatown</category><category>downtown</category><category>job</category><category>life</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>A Short, Sharp Shock</title><link>/a-short-sharp-shock.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One morning a few weeks back I was told to get in early to meet about an
upcoming release that was happening...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we were in for a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of my co-workers and I were laid off that morning, along with 23
other unlucky souls from different parts of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense I can understand the necessity for this kind of overt
deception - there are certainly a non trivial number of people who would
not react well to "Hey, be sure to be in by X time, because we're doing
lay offs and we don't want your tardiness to clog up the gears!", but I
can't help but feel there has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason this one was a bit harder than most for me to accept,
because I loved working at the Broad and had no desire to leave. I don't
harbor any ill will against anyone over it - everyone was just doing
their jobs, and in truth save for my misgivings about leading lambs to
the slaughter like that, I think everyone handled the whole process with
a great deal of professionalism, which is all anyone can ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of working with a bunch of incredibly bright,
talented, friendly people for 4 years. In high tech that's a pretty good
run actually!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm doing the job search thing again. I chose to eschew the job
placement seminars and such they'd set up for us - I know how to polish
my resume and how to interview, and to my mind that 2 or three days was
much better spent trying to find a soft place for myself to land while
the incredible shrinking job market vaporized before my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been very lucky, things are actually going very well thus far -
I've had 2 first round interviews and one 2nd round, with another set
for today, and two more first round interviews set for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we'll see where all of this leads me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say enough about how amazing my wife has been through all of
this - I'm a very lucky guy indeed :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2009 04:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2009-02-19:a-short-sharp-shock.html</guid><category>Broad</category><category>career</category><category>job</category><category>layoff</category><category>MIT</category><category>search</category></item><item><title>FEAR THE IMPENDING SNOW-POCALYPSE!</title><link>/fear-the-impending-snow-pocalypse.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am being amused watching people run around panicking over the coming

&lt;p&gt;THIS IS NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE. IT SNOWS HERE! GET USED TO IT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I'm looking forward to this storm. Unlike the freezing rain
and ice issues we've had of late, you can actually frolic and play in
the white fluffy stuff and not get yourself killed :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2008 11:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-12-19:fear-the-impending-snow-pocalypse.html</guid><category>new england</category><category>snow</category><category>weather</category><category>winter</category></item><item><title>Rock Band 2 Special Edition Box - Awesome :)</title><link>/rock-band-2-special-edition-box-awesome.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My wife was kind enough to indulge my penchant for video games this
evening by helping me unpack and set up the Rock Band 2 Special Edition
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite a production! Lots of parts and a bit of part a slot b
assembly, but the totally picture based instructions were clear and the
instruments were &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; well constructed. Each part that needed to be
inserted into another gave a satisfying click when it was seated
properly, and everything had a very rugged feel - no chintzy plastic
pieces or flimsy parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorials are excellent and get the player up to speed with his/her
instrument very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly settled into playing the bass track with the guitar - there
were many fewer notes so the songs were much easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife tried the drum set, and looking at her track as we played the
songs I was struck by how much harder her end of things was. She also
mentioned a couple of times how sensitive the drums were to being hit
exactly on center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time I'll try the drums and she'll give the bass guitar a shot
:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am very very impressed. As a fan of Harmoinix from way back (I
own Frequency for the PS2) it's a lot of fun to watch them evolve the
genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to having some time to practice some more, and maybe try
out the microphone!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2008 21:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-11-02:rock-band-2-special-edition-box-awesome.html</guid><category>bass</category><category>drums</category><category>gaming</category><category>guitar</category><category>rock band</category><category>songs</category><category>video games</category></item><item><title>Conflicted about MA state Question 3: Banning dog racing</title><link>/conflicted-about-ma-state-question-3-banning-dog-racing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As others have pointed out, both sides on this issue are jumping up and
down shrilly screaming the facts as they claim to see them at the top of
their lungs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But real, verifiable facts are mightily hard to come by. I'm personally
rather conflicted on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my wife and I are serious dog people. She can spot a puppy at 500
yards in a bustling crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is getting all sorts of messages from the MSPCA and their ilk
claiming that the dogs are being horribly abused and that it must stop
RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vote No on 3 contingent is mostly coming off sounding combative and
shrill as well. Their Boston Globe piece reminded me of conservative
talk radio - it might as well have been written by Rush Limbaugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks over at &lt;a href="http://protectdogsandjobs.org/" title="Vote NO on Massachusetts Question 3 - Protect Dogs and Our Jobs - Home"&gt;Protect Dogs and
Jobs&lt;/a&gt;
are citing the loss of 1,000 jobs and \$4 million in state revenue if
the ban passes, and claiming that the incidence of dog injury in the
sport is incredibly small (1 injury for every 1000 dogs racing -
something like .1%) and compare that to the injury stat for Girls
Volleyball which is at 1.47%. the only thing I keep hearing from these
folks about the abuse allegations is "Owners have every incentive to
treat their dogs well, so they'll race well" - but I'm not sure how well
that theory holds water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is right? Are the dogs actually being abused, or is this people
getting carried away with themselves on principle and ignoring the
actual facts of the matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a voter, it's a tough call. I have my mind pretty well made up on the
other two (No and yes respectively) but I'm very much on the fence with
this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any opinions on this? Or better yet any actual
experience with the way the dogs are treated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ Edit: November 3rd, tomorrow is E day :) My wife and I plan to hit the
polls early. I am no longer conflicted about this question, due to some
excellent responses I got on my LiveJournal and some tertiary research I
did as a result, I am now solidly in favor of the ban. I'm concerned
that dogs which participate in racing are adversely effected by this,
and their personalities are permanently damaged as a result. ]&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 13:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-10-24:conflicted-about-ma-state-question-3-banning-dog-racing.html</guid><category>3</category><category>ballot</category><category>ban</category><category>dogs</category><category>greyhound</category><category>politics</category><category>questions</category><category>racing</category></item><item><title>INSUFFERABLE CUTENESS!</title><link>/insufferable-cuteness.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;[ Note: Adorable Golden retriever picture behind the cut. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are dog sitting for one of my wife's co-workers this weekend. He's a
big lovable Golden named Buddy, and I am totally smitten :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Buddy

&lt;p&gt;As anyone who knows me can attest, I was owned by a Golden for years
back in my pre college days, and I've been wanting another one ever
since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, my wife is also an easy mark for such a big adorable fluff
ball, so I might have a shot at it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go take our after dinner walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2008 16:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-10-04:insufferable-cuteness.html</guid><category>adorable</category><category>buddy</category><category>cute</category><category>dog</category><category>fuzzy</category><category>golden</category><category>golden retriever</category><category>puppy</category></item><item><title>Something for nothing when you don't *WANT IT* is still damn annoying.</title><link>/something-for-nothing-when-you-dont-want-it-is-still-damn-annoying.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Sun;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you tell me I hava Java (TM) updates available on my work Windows
machine, I gleefully say sure why not and click through the installer,
because generally Sun provided updates to my installed JDK don't do
anything evil, and with security and all it's a good idea to stay up to
date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER - trying to shoehorn OpenOffice into the mix is downright
annoying, and I resent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have anything at all against OpenOffice. In fact, it's a Class
A piece of open source software and is damn impressive for what it is,
what it does, and how much it costs (\$0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I and many other users have exactly zero use for OpenOffice
because we have the arguably more powerful Microsoft Office suite
already installed on our machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take no issue with having a little checkbox that says "Hey, want to
get OpenOffice along with Java?" because at least I can check that off
if I want, or not. But having your Java update installer constantly
display ads for OpenOffice, and having it give me &lt;strong&gt;no choice&lt;/strong&gt; in the
matter as to whether or not I want the ferschlugging OpenOffice
installer is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software sells itself, Sun, there's no reason to try to sneak it
under the radar of unsuspecting users just because you want to be able
to claim more seats. Last time you tried this with Netbeans, and look at
how well that turned out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, get a clue people, really. Truth in advertising, let me do what I
mean and don't try to install software that I need whether I realize it
or not, it just pisses me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grumph, enough ranting for now :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2008 11:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-10-02:something-for-nothing-when-you-dont-want-it-is-still-damn-annoying.html</guid><category>annoyances</category><category>free</category><category>Installers</category><category>Java</category><category>OpenOffice</category><category>software</category><category>Sun</category><category>Windows</category></item><item><title>Quite a whirlwind couple of weeks.</title><link>/quite-a-whirlwind-couple-of-weeks.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I guess the big news in my life of late is that I turned 40 last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and friends put on a really incredible party. They went over
the top decorating our house - it was beautiful. Everyone who came
seemed to have a wonderful time, and I enjoyed myself tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party aside though, it's interesting how (for me anyway, other people
differ I'm sure) birthdays that end in zero inevitably engender a kind
of check pointing. An opportunity to step back, try to take an objective
look at things, and say to ones self "Am I where I want to be, and if
not, how can I get there?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely a bunch of personal challenges I intend to take on
over the next decade (Around things like self discipline and career
direction) but on the whole I am exactly where I wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amazes me that &lt;strong&gt;10 years&lt;/strong&gt; have flown by since I turned 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I was much less happy and well adjusted at that point,
and there were many things in my life I wanted and needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was beginning to see foreshadows of certain decisions I had made and
paths I was treading down, but didn't have enough confidence in my own
instincts and intuition to take evasive action before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few years for things to spiral down to (for me) rock bottom
and then, once I made the tough changes that needed making, another
couple of years to enjoy the healthy bachelor life and truly recover,
but by thirty seven / thirty eight I had met my wife, and things have
gotten steadily (and dramatically!) better since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I look back across the last decade, I can't help but be reminded
of how lucky I am. I have enjoyed the support of friends and
acquaintances near and far. Each of them has contributed in some
meaningful way to who I am today, Thanks, everybody! It's been quite a
trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next decade!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2008 13:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-09-29:quite-a-whirlwind-couple-of-weeks.html</guid><category>40</category><category>age</category><category>birthday</category><category>friends</category><category>growth</category><category>life</category><category>thoughts</category><category>time</category></item><item><title>DEAD is dead!</title><link>/dead-is-dead.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a rather 'meta' moment today after reading another article
bemoaning the death of the PC as a gaming platform (An assertion of at
best dubious nature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, I realized that just about every single instance of
someone wailing "X is DEAD!" turned out to either be patently untrue or
at least a severely twisted view of the facts at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The desktop is dead. The web *IS* the platform!"&lt;br /&gt;
"PC gaming is dead. Next gen consoles rule supreme!"&lt;br /&gt;
"Disco is dead!"&lt;br /&gt;
"God is dead!"&lt;br /&gt;
"Paul is (a) dead(man)!"&lt;br /&gt;
"Table top role playing is dead!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. Clearly, we need to re-examine our conceptions around
exactly what it means for something to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This blog is DEAD!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem. Maybe not :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 05:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-08-18:dead-is-dead.html</guid><category>articles</category><category>behavior</category><category>blogs</category><category>gaming</category><category>meta</category><category>pc</category></item><item><title>Yeah yeah, so I know it's the oldest past time outside of prostitution but...</title><link>/yeah-yeah-so-i-know-its-the-oldest-past-time-outside-of-prostitution-but.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've just &lt;strong&gt;gotta&lt;/strong&gt; say that the &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; thunder, lightning, and
torrential rain storms can stop any time now.  Really, we are in zero
danger of droubt, and the summer is trickling away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go on vacation starting tomorrow evening, so I will be praying to any
deity I think will listen for a break in this weather and a return to
the sunny summer currently (not!) in progress :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, like you all are just thrilled to be listening to me kvetch. 
I'll stop now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yay, impending vacation - no matter what the weather it will be fun!)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2008 00:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-08-08:yeah-yeah-so-i-know-its-the-oldest-past-time-outside-of-prostitution-but.html</guid><category>complaints</category><category>lightning</category><category>rain</category><category>thunder</category><category>vacation</category><category>weather</category></item><item><title>The Xbox 360 has landed!</title><link>/the-xbox-360-has-landed.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have suffered as much pain and heaped as much hatred in Redmond's
general direction as the next battle hardened veteran geek, but man,
this console is home entertainment done right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of box hook up couldn't possibly be any easier. Plug the power
brick into the wall and the Xbox360, plug the HDMI cable into your TV,
plug the ethernet cable into your network and away you go. It's that
simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network setup was beyond trivial - the unit set itself up properly
despite my somewhat complex home network configuration (I have a Linksys
and a Buffalo wifi router both running WDS, one doing NAT duties for the
house) and was talking to Xbox Live and downloading updates immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the Elite model, with the 120GB HD, so it comes with 'auto
download' turned on. I rather like this (Some would find it annoying I'm
sure) as it means that my console is pre-seeded with all the latest
demos so I can play all the hot new games to get an idea of what they're
like before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wow, the picture quality with this thing and a nice HD set is
impressive. I'm finding that video from the XB360 looks much better than
HD video from cable (I'm guessing this is a result of the compression I
keep hearing that cable companies like Comcast use.). I only have
Bioshock and Mass Effect thus far, and that they look amazing probably
goes without saying given the hype around them before and after their
release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the XB360 experience I'm rather fond of are 'zones' -
your choices are Recreational, Family, Pro, and Underground. This means
that folks like me who are exceedingly unlikely to spend 22 hours
straight playing Halo to hone their attack skills aren't pitted against
people who haven't seen the sun in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also surprised to see the depth and breadth of decidedly casual
games in the 'arcade' section, for people who eschew shooters and the
'temple of twitch' style of gaming.  Old board gaming standards like
Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, and Lost Cities are notable in their
presence, as well as a bunch of arcade classics I was pleased to see
being introduced to new generations of gamers (Like Gauntlet and Joust. 
Blue Valkyrie needs food badly! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my gamer tag is 'forthewyn' in case anyone else out there has an
Xbox and cares to add me to their friend list.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2008 15:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-08-04:the-xbox-360-has-landed.html</guid><category>fun</category><category>games</category><category>internet</category><category>media</category><category>tv</category><category>video games</category><category>xbox</category><category>xbox360</category></item><item><title>With all this rain we've been getting...</title><link>/with-all-this-rain-weve-been-getting.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Staring out the window just now at the torrential rains, I had a very
vivid memory of a really pleasant day many years ago...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in High School I think, and a friend of mine (He was my 'Big
Brother' actually, a program I was in for kids whose fathers weren't
around so we&lt;br /&gt;
could get some sense of what it's like to be a man - I think it only
partially worked :) ) and I were canoeing around &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=Lake+Dennison,&amp;amp;near=Templeton,+MA&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;view=text&amp;amp;latlng=9446610972854578859&amp;amp;dtab=0&amp;amp;ei=BLGISJHMJomKjAHY9bWhBw&amp;amp;oi=&amp;amp;sa=X#" title="Google Maps"&gt;Lake
Dennison&lt;/a&gt;
in Templeton, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been a lot of rain that year too, a LOT of rain, and the
lake's water level was threatening to swell over the top and flood the
beach entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
This made for some beautiful canoeing, since it allowed us to row down
a series of inlets which would normally have been almost totally
inaccessible&lt;br /&gt;
by foot because of the dense brush. It was just gorgeous out there, the
air smelled incredibly lush and green, and there were flowers and small
wild&lt;br /&gt;
life all around - we managed to get within perfect viewing distance of
a doe and her fawn before they pranced away, and we're pretty sure we
disturbed&lt;br /&gt;
the work of a beaver or two that wasn't at all used to the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's funny how when you get older (and I don't even mean ancient either,
just middle aged) memories can take on not just the rosy glow of years
long&lt;br /&gt;
past but a strange intensity all their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stink at canoeing, but I do hope I can go out rowing even on a row
boat or something again someday. I miss those quiet moments on the lake
:)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2008 20:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-07-23:with-all-this-rain-weve-been-getting.html</guid><category>boating</category><category>lakes</category><category>memories</category><category>outdoors</category></item><item><title>Breaking the silence - Ireland.</title><link>/breaking-the-silence-ireland.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over a month ago now, my wife and I went on vacation with her boss and
friend and another friend of hers to Ireland...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the CIE 'A Taste of Ireland" bus tour, and had an amazing time.
This was my first trip to Europe, and unsurprisingly, I found it
amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland is definitely a party country, if there could be said to be such
a thing :) It seemed like there were Guinness taps everywhere. Being&lt;br /&gt;
rather a fan, this could hardly be considered a problem for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Guinness, on our first day we visited the Guinness brewery
in St. James Gate. The initial 'tour' is kind of neat, although mostly
just&lt;br /&gt;
multimedia presentations and the like about how it's made. The real
bonanza however, and the reason that I feel no Guinness fan should miss
a visit,&lt;br /&gt;
is the 'Gravity Bar' on the top floor of the brewery. You only get 1
pint of Guinness (probably to cut down on loitering and move people
through) but&lt;br /&gt;
I have to say it's the best pint I've ever tasted. Most of the other
pubs we visited had fine Guinness, but really it wasn't particularly any
more&lt;br /&gt;
tasty than a pint drawn at a really good pub here in the US that knows
how to handle its Guinness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus tour itself was incredible, but a bit grueling. A typical day
involved getting up at 6:30 to get to breakfast at 7:30 so we could pile
onto&lt;br /&gt;
the bus for 8:00. After that, it was a dizzying whirl wind of
destinations and picture taking, and usually around 5:30 in the evening
they'd dump&lt;br /&gt;
us at our destination where we'd be staying for the night, and we'd all
crawl away to freshen up and try to recover enough to enjoy the
evening's&lt;br /&gt;
festivities :) In addition to the sheer endurance required for the
trip, we definitely experienced the expected feeling that in a number of
cases,&lt;br /&gt;
we would have *REALLY* liked to have more time to explore (For
instance we never kissed the Blarney Stone because we had exactly 2.5
hours to&lt;br /&gt;
have lunch, explore the Blarney Woolen Mills, and visit Castle
Blarney!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't detail everything we saw, it would get boring for both of us and
there's no point - consult a good travel guide and you'll get better&lt;br /&gt;
writing than I can muster anyway. A couple of tidbits I particularly
enjoyed were seeing Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a stop we
made&lt;br /&gt;
at a working sheep farm (You have no idea what it actually sounds like
to have 1,000 sheep being herded :) ), and a buggy ride through
Kilarney&lt;br /&gt;
National Park with a stop at Castle Ross, whose ruins are still in
remarkably good shape allowing you to wander around, climb the ramparts,
and&lt;br /&gt;
generally get up close and personal in the kind of relaxed way I most
enjoy exploring a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talented wife took about a billion pictures - I took a few as well
but if you see the angle skewed oddly it's probably mine - she has a
real&lt;br /&gt;
eye for composition! You can look at them on
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/feoh/sets/72157605216185951/" title="Ireland Tour 2008 - a set on Flickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we'll go to Italy next year, if I don't convince her that a nice
relaxing sunny beach vacation on an island somewhere is the way to go :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2008 11:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-07-23:breaking-the-silence-ireland.html</guid><category>europe</category><category>fun</category><category>ireland</category><category>travel</category><category>vacation</category></item><item><title>Ireland trip, work business, general update stuff.</title><link>/ireland-trip-work-business-general-update-stuff.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of those rare occasions when I have nothing more to say than
a brief status update...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life has been good, but &lt;strong&gt;busy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, the &lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org/" title="Maven - Welcome to Maven"&gt;Maven
2&lt;/a&gt; transition is
slated to happen this weekend. If we can carry it off successfully, I
will be able to trundle off across the pond with a giant weight lifted
from my shoulders as we've been working towards this for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of trundling off across the pond - We're headed to Ireland next
week. We're in that frenzied pre vacation phase where we're trying to
ensure that we take everything we need while still traveling
(comparatively) light. This is all very exciting for me, as it'll be my
first trip to Europe, and also my first international vacation as a
married man :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a tour, which honestly I was not entirely thrilled at the prospect
of at first (I tend to like to identify my own points of interest and
see them at my own pace) but I'm comforted by the idea that we'll be
spending a full two days at each destination so at least I don't have to
worry about being whisked from place to place in rapid fire succession
(I &lt;strong&gt;HATE&lt;/strong&gt; that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's all for now. More when I return :) Hope this note finds
everyone well!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2008 23:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-05-07:ireland-trip-work-business-general-update-stuff.html</guid><category>europe</category><category>ireland</category><category>life</category><category>travel</category><category>vacation</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>Another whirlwind weekend in Manhattan</title><link>/another-whirlwind-weekend-in-manhattan.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This was first and foremost a visit to spend time with my wife's
family...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But as always we managed to sneak some fun in between the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had brunch at &lt;a href="http://www.vynl-nyc.com/" title="Vynl Locations"&gt;Vynl&lt;/a&gt;. This
place is downright fun, from the records decorating the walls to the
album jacket menus to the bathrooms each with their own unique theme -
The Beatles, Madonna, etc. Happily, the brunch food is actually quite
good. We had and can enthusiastically recommend the banana pecan
pancakes, the brioche french toast, and the make your own omelette
option. The large glasses of tasty fresh squeezed orange juice are also
a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick stop at the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/week/20080413.html" title="Apple Store - Fifth Avenue"&gt;Manhattan Apple Store on Fifth
Avenue&lt;/a&gt;
and were amazed at the multi-national throng as we jostled our way in
only to decide that the shopping we'd hoped to do for a relative was
impossible, and found our way out again (The place was &lt;strong&gt;packed&lt;/strong&gt; -
hundreds of people at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day while trolling around for something to fill a couple of
idle hours, we ended up at the &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/listings/bar/king_cole_bar_lounge/" title="King Cole Bar Lounge - - Midtown East - New York Magazine Bar Guide"&gt;King Cole
Lounge&lt;/a&gt;
at the gorgeous and elegant &lt;a href="http://specialoffers.starwoodhotels.com/stregisnyc" title="St. Regis New York Hotels: The St. Regis New York - Hotel Rooms at stregis.com"&gt;St. Regis
Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.
If you're lucky enough to get a table (We only scored one due to the
generosity of a couple whose party unexpectedly shrank due to the
departure of some friends) you'll be treated to a viewing of a beautiful
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish" title="Maxfield Parrish - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;Maxfield
Parrish&lt;/a&gt;
mural depicting King Cole looking on bemusedly at the festivities. The
drinks are stiff, well made and very tasty, and the bar snacks are
unusually good. I had a Big Apple Manhattan and the ladies got
Pomegranate martinis which both got rave reviews. Apparently, the Red
Snapper cocktail they serve here is the ancestor to the modern &lt;a href="http://www.twoop.com/food_drink/archives/2005/10/bloody_mary_cocktail.html" title="Bloody Mary Cocktail Timeline and History"&gt;Bloody
Mary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having wiled away the aforementioned time in tipsy elegance, we made our
way over to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shunleepalace.com%2Fnewyork%2F&amp;amp;ei=vO4ESL3YFY7yecP24CI&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEEWKSfl83bO3oX2vVkKtUVqFI1Aw&amp;amp;sig2=IeMl8zEpihNS7h89isd5ug"&gt;Shun Li
Palace&lt;/a&gt;
where we met up with some other family for dinner. This is perhaps not
the most authentic Chinese food I've ever encountered, but wow is it
tasty. Also, the atmosphere is decidedly upscale. There is a significant
wine list, and the staff are decked out in full suit attire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between too many bar snacks and a lovely dinner, we waddled back to our
&lt;a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ic/1/en/hotel/nycha?&amp;amp;sitrackingid=11567879&amp;amp;sicreative=502516696&amp;amp;sicontent=0&amp;amp;firstpoint=dcb1&amp;amp;siclientid=1911&amp;amp;cm_mmc=Google-PS-InterContinental-_-G+B-AmericasEast-_-NY-NYC-_-intercontinental+barclay+nyc%7C-%7C100000000000002341259&amp;amp;gclid=CPCsq8vV3ZICFQGAHgodxzH5iw" title="InterContinental NEW YORK CITY Hotels | THE BARCLAY NEW YORK | Welcome"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;
(Yay Priceline. We'd never have stayed there otherwise) and passed out
in a happy blissful drink and dinner induced haze :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2008 08:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-04-15:another-whirlwind-weekend-in-manhattan.html</guid></item><item><title>You fought the good fight, Hillary, now it's time to hang up the skates.</title><link>/you-fought-the-good-fight-hillary-now-its-time-to-hang-up-the-skates.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I heard on the news this morning that Hillary only has between a 5 and
10 percent chance of winning the nomination at this point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the question I keep asking myself is: Why is she still in the race?
What does she hope to gain? Is she so selfishly myopic that she's
willing to tank the democratic party's chances for winning this
election?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My respect for her and those around her is dwindling rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on Hillary, wake up and smell the coffee. It's time you started
thinking more about the nation you claim to care about and less about
the bruised ego you'll have to endure if you lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Obama continues to run a classy campaign - I realize that some
retaliation is necessary in order to be seen as a tenacious and forceful
candidate, but people grow fickle and cynical &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; quickly,
especially with many on both sides of the party line feeling like McCain
is a lesser evil (I don't agree with this, but it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a commonly held
opinion right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 300 days until Bush leaves office, I want to be doing the touch
down dance at election time along with hundreds and thousands of other
Americans who feel like we've been misled and mismanaged for too many
years.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2008 07:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-03-26:you-fought-the-good-fight-hillary-now-its-time-to-hang-up-the-skates.html</guid><category>2008</category><category>clinton</category><category>democratic</category><category>election</category><category>hillary</category><category>parties</category><category>party</category><category>politics</category><category>president</category></item><item><title>Apparently hell froze over - Apple made Safari into a usable web browser!</title><link>/apparently-hell-froze-over-apple-made-safari-into-a-usable-web-browser.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have *wanted* to be a Safari user...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every time I would try I would end up using it for 5 minutes and
then find myself butting heads with a site that's entirely unreadable
using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hard core Mac zealot friends would wave their arms and say "BUT THOSE
SITES AREN'T STANDARDS CONFORMANT!" which is probably true, but there
are times I simply want to be an end user, and web browsing is one of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, with version 1.3 Apple seems to have improved the HTML, CSS and
Javascript rendering support enough that all of the sites that I tested
which used to fail utterly or render useless results under older
versions now work like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Apple for having had the sense to bring their default web
browser for OSX up to the excellent user experience standards exhibited
by the rest of its environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2008 11:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-03-18:apparently-hell-froze-over-apple-made-safari-into-a-usable-web-browser.html</guid><category>apple</category><category>browser</category><category>css</category><category>DOM</category><category>html</category><category>javascript</category><category>Macintosh</category><category>safari</category><category>standards</category><category>web</category></item><item><title>Dear Mayor Menino</title><link>/dear-mayor-menino.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you think &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/03/17/menino_backs_bill_to_keep_violent_video_games_away_from_children/"&gt;banning violent video game sales to
minors&lt;/a&gt;
will reduce the murder rate...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are deluding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find really troubling here is not the actual ban itself (I can't
think of the last time I bought a video game, much less a violent / gory
video game, inside Boston city limits) but instead another step in the
direction of absolving parents of the responsibility of raising their
children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All one has to do is simply look around at the scads of minors smoking
tobacco - a clear and present danger to anyone's health - to see that
government regulation is not the answer to what is in reality a social
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media has been making allusions about this being an attempt to
mitigate the recent rise in murders in the Boston area. I see this as a
cop out on the part of the mayor's office. Rather than attacking the
actual social problems at the root of this trend, they stand on the
highest mountain top and make a lot of noise while slapping an utterly
ineffective band aid over a sucking chest wound.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2008 10:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-03-17:dear-mayor-menino.html</guid><category>ban</category><category>boston</category><category>city</category><category>crime</category><category>gaming</category><category>laws</category><category>murder</category><category>problems</category><category>society</category><category>video games</category><category>violence</category><category>youth</category></item><item><title>Genes, lifestyle, and longevity</title><link>/genes-lifestyle-and-longevity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So I spent the weekend with my lovely wife and her family celebrating...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;her Nanna's 90th birthday. She had another uncle present who is 94 years
old and seems more spry and active than some thirty somethings I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to reflect a little bit on the fact that &lt;strong&gt;nobody&lt;/strong&gt; in my
family lives into their nineties, and damn few live into their eighties
(Or have thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that could readily explain this without
too much digging. My family has traditionally been lower middle class,
blue collar workers. As I've mentioned here before, my mom and dad meet
during WWII while working as mechanics repairing amphibious vehicles (My
dad was her foreman :). My uncles and cousins mostly worked in plastic
factories and the like, and all but the most recent generation smoked
all their (comparatively short) lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If longevity could be thought of as a graph with lifestyle, age and
genetics all expressed as axes, I wonder what our two families would
look like? Add in recent developments in the understanding of how
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt; effects
longevity and by extension how the environment and lifestyle of an
organism can effects its offspring one, two or even three or more
generations down the line, and you wind up with a dizzying
multi-dimensional data structure whose representation I can't even
fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda leaves me feeling grateful that we're not planning on having
children any time soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rant (meander? pile of babble? I dunno) has no conclusion per se.
Just a bunch of thoughts that have been rolling around in my head for a
bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2008 16:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-03-11:genes-lifestyle-and-longevity.html</guid><category>aging</category><category>diet</category><category>exercise</category><category>family</category><category>genetics</category><category>health</category><category>lifestyle</category></item><item><title>Where but for the grace of god go I.</title><link>/where-but-for-the-grace-of-god-go-i.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't usually throw around Catholic / Christian memes like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But in this case I can't think of an expression that captures the
feeling more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been really busy at work. We're finally making the cut to a
new build system (geeky details elided for now and will appear in a
later, blog only post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has been sucking up a big chunk of my waking hours and more of my
consciousness than I'd like, but that will change shortly and I love my
job so c'est la vis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I'm not working, or spending time with my lovely wife,
I've been reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been obsessed with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Furst"&gt;Alan
Furst&lt;/a&gt; novels. They're set
before and/or during the WWII era and range all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two novels in particular focus on life in the pre war Russian
secret service - the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I just want to take a minute to gush. I didn't realize how
much I could enjoy historical fiction until I encountered this author. I
have yet to read another author's work that compares to the kind of lush
historical and cultural detail Furst expertly weaves into the story in
these books. He has taken the time to research all the little things
(idioms of speech, modes of dress, customs and folkways) that run
together to create an incredibly rich tapestry that forms the backdrop
for the events large and small, personal and impersonal that make these
stories shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one thing to learn in history class about the fact that there were
massive purges during this era and that millions of eastern europeans
died, it's another all together to see it through one man's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both novels protagonists ended up on the wrong kind of lists (A likely
fate for an NKVD spy of any rank, because in the pre-war era Stalin
purged just about the entire Soviet intelligence community, as well as
most ranking officers of the army) and defecting, trying to find a new
life among the refugees safe from the assassin's bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ceaselessly amazed by the potential and even the penchant that
mankind has for eradicating itself. I realize this is human nature, but
it just doesn't make &lt;strong&gt;sense&lt;/strong&gt; at such a deep level of my psyche that I
find myself shaking my head at it when I encounter it as if each time
were the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story is quite simple: It's very easy to become mired
in the day to day travails of our lives and careers, but it's definitely
worth standing back for a moment and taking stock of just how good we
all have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us (I should hope anyway!) has to wake up every morning
thinking: "Is today my day? Do I get a bullet or a paycheck?" and that's
saying something.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2008 14:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-03-05:where-but-for-the-grace-of-god-go-i.html</guid><category>Alan Furst</category><category>books</category><category>bulgaria</category><category>espionage</category><category>europe</category><category>fiction</category><category>history</category><category>kgb</category><category>nkvd</category><category>reading</category><category>russia</category><category>russian</category><category>spies</category><category>spying</category><category>war</category><category>WWII</category></item><item><title>Oh yeah! Laurie Anderson is coming to Boston!</title><link>/oh-yeah-laurie-anderson-is-coming-to-boston.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I first came to the Boston area, Laurie Anderson held a
concert at MIT...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I thought nothing of it. Laurie Anderson was just a wacky
artist whose music friends of mine adored in college, but I never really
understood the appeal of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several years and a whole lot of living, and zoom in on me
buying the "Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists" CD. It was a
collection of all manner of forward thinking artists - names like Brian
Eno, Devo, Beck, Thomas Dolby, and of course, Laurie Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the music on that CD, Laurie Anderson's _O Superman: Massonet_
really resonated with a lot I was thinking and feeling at the time. I
was both impressed and intrigued, and decided it was time to revisit my
now many years stale distaste for her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went out and bought one of her more seminal albums, _Big Science_
and was promptly blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Anderson stands apart from the pack because she makes music that
makes you think. I'm not saying she's the only artist that embodies that
characteristic, but she's definitely the poster child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, she's coming to Boston on Saturday, March 29th to the Opera
House - an incredible venue if you've never been. The acoustics are
amazing, the environs are opulent and richly detailed in that way only
old music and art houses can be, and I can't think of an artist in the
modern musical field who might use them to better advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ever supportive wife (She's yet to hear any Laurie Anderson - I'm
thinking I'll let her be surprised and see how she reacts :) and I are
going, and I am psyched!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if any of my readers are planning on being there, it would
be neat to compare notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When love is gone, there's always justice. And when justice is gone,
there's always force. And when force is gone, there's always Mom. Hi,
Mom!&lt;br /&gt;
--Laurie Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
People are really suffering these days. There's a lot of corporate
triumph and a lot of personal despair as they wonder what are they
working for.&lt;br /&gt;

    "teh" again, I will be a happy man.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Just sayin'. This may have been effective about 20 years ago when
    the first person who propagated this
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" title="Meme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;,
    but now it's tired. So &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; tired.&lt;/li&gt;

    I like rap. A good friend many years ago in college walked up to me
    one day when I was ranting at some friends about how I thought rap
    was just chaotic noise and nothing else, and said "Rap is one of the
    most politically active forms of music on the planet, and that's a
    fact.". He was right. All that's beside the point though, ebonics
    are seeping their way into main stream speech in ways I find most
    unfortunate. It can stop any time now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wassssssuupppppp!!! - the original Bud marketing campaign was
    brilliant, and even funny in spots (I still enjoy the sushi bar
    version - Wasabii!!!) but this meme is so tired it needs to be taken
    out back and shot - a mercy kill at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling everyone "Kid" whether they be 18 or 80 - Maybe the denizens
    of Southie can get grand fathered in on this one, I dunno, but the
    rest of you should really stop watching those Martin Scorsese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, I realize that in truth I have no business at all

&lt;p&gt;Go take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.flocabulary.com/"&gt;Flocabulary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece that actually left me chuckling on this snowy wet morning was
&lt;a href="http://www.flocabulary.com/shakessample2.html" title="Love's Desire - Shakespeare is Hip-Hop"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
A Hip hopped up Cliffs Notes version of Romeo and Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea - speaking to kids using a medium they're comfortable
with. In no way do I think this should replace a full and careful
reading with explanations by the teacher, but for some children there's
a lot of ground to cover before they're able or ready to be successful
in such an endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

cooking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both definitely the kind of people who ate out most of the time
for a big chunk of our adult lives, and who didn't pay nearly as much
attention as we should have to our parents in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a bit of a process coming up to speed with cooking for
ourselves on a regular basis, and evolving past the point of things like
pasta, simple grilling, and simple frying, and getting to the point
where we have a small repertoire of recipes we're very comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few potentially obvious things that are worth restating anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If cooking for yourself beyond boiling water seems daunting, Just Do
    It. That feeling abates after the first few successes in the
    kitchen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't bite off more than you can chew. Start with recipes that
    involve only a few steps. Better to build your confidence with
    several small, satisfying victories than to go out with a bang and
    resign yourself to eternal take out again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with a partner is much more fun, and besides, then you'll
    have someone to share dinner with :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow cookers are awesome. Nothing says "Hey, even I can't screw this
    up!" like a recipe that calls for cooking something on LOW for 8-9
    hours. In fact, I have a pot roast bubbling away in mine at home
    right now :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try the no knead bread recipe! It's idiot proof. I should know, I've
    succeeded at using it twice and made two lovely loaves of bread -
    very well reviewed by everyone we had handy both times :) The recipe
    originally appeared in the &lt;a href="www.http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;New York
    Times&lt;/a&gt; but my favorite rendition which
    includes some nice refinements and is a whole lot more fun is &lt;a href="http://steamykitchen.com/blog/2007/09/10/no-knead-bread-revisited/"&gt;over
    here&lt;/a&gt;
    on the &lt;a href="http://steamykitchen.com"&gt;Jaden's Steamy Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the less obvious stuff, and the reason I bothered writing this
to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Kitchen Tools are Worth Their Weight in Gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I had always said "Well, I'm hardly a kitchen maven, so I
really don't need the good stuff. What I have is fine." What I had was a
worn out mish mash of hand me downs from my family that I had been using
since my dorm days in college. Dull knives, cheap pots and pans with hot
spots galore that looked like they'd been through a world war or two.
You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy, was I wrong! When we got married and my wife and were prompted by
several of her relatives to start a wedding registry, I thought, "This
is an opportunity to get the Good Stuff". Due to the tremendous
generosity of our families and friends we ended up with a nice set of
&lt;a href="http://www.all-clad.com/"&gt;All-Clad&lt;/a&gt; cook ware and
&lt;a href="http://www.jahenckels.com/"&gt;Henckels&lt;/a&gt; knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was blown away. It's the classic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiled_frog"&gt;Boiled
Frog&lt;/a&gt; syndrome. You really
have no idea how much easier and more pleasant it is to cook with good
tools until you have them in your home and use them a few times. The
difference really is like night and day. In the same vein, it's been
really nice to watch my wife use one of these tools for the first time
and say "Hey, wow, this is a really great knife" or "It's amazing how
you easy this pan is to clean" etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to come off sounding like an advertisement for either of
these two product lines - I am quite certain that any of the other
equivalently capable lines of kitchen tools will lend the same kind of
pleasure to your kitchen endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, writing something like this has been rattling around in my head
for a while. I know I wasn't the only kitchen phobic geek out there, so
I thought some of this bore mentioning. Hopefully it's not totally
incoherent, and people can get something out of it. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2008 09:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2008-01-11:kitchen-tools-why-getting-the-good-stuff-is-worth-it.html</guid><category>beginner</category><category>cooking</category><category>food</category><category>kitchen</category><category>knives</category><category>pans</category><category>pots</category><category>tools</category></item><item><title>Semi obscure music question</title><link>/semi-obscure-music-question.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Read no further if you think Phish is just a misspelling of those things
with fins and scales......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know which Phish album and song contains an A Cappella
version of the mourner's kaddish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's out there somewhere because I've heard it multiple times, I
just can't for the life of me remember which album it's on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that it's not the mourner's kaddish, but is instead a
Jewish funerary song called "Jerusalem, City of Gold" and is included at
the end of the song "Demand" on Phish's "Hoist" album.  View most of the

Now if only people could cope.</title><link>/ah-a-real-new-england-winter-now-if-only-people-could-cope.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, when the first &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; snow storm hits, people allow the
media to whip them into a fine frothy frenzy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never cease to be amazed at this phenomenon. You would think that the
hundreds of thousands of people who live here year in year out would get
the hint, see the pattern, clue in, or something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual rounds of closures, hubbub and horrendous
traffic jams (Induced by said closures and media frency) people also
somehow managge to forget, ignore, or otherwise avoid the simple
expedient of shoveling their side walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is exacerbated by absentee land lords who write clauses like
"Tenant is in charge of snow removal" into their lease (Which I'm told
is of questionable legality to begin with, but I'm hardly a lawyer so I
dunno). Your average college kid simply isn't going to feel motivated by
a sense of civic duty enough to get his/her butt out there on a winter's
day and start shoveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that there was a time when, if you didn't shovel your walk,
you would be fined by the city. I whole heartedly approve of this
practice and wish they'd bring it back. If you are elderly, infirm, or
otherwise unable to shovel your walk, you should hire someone to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't afford it, I would question whether or not you should be
owning property. This is somewhat harsh, but the truth is that when you
own a house in the city, you are sharing space with the rest of us, and
some responsibilities to the community come with that. Elder care and
charity should help pitch in for those truly needy cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on a positive note - aside from the impassable, icy sidewalks, I
am actually very much enjoying this winter. It's almost a relief in a
weird sort of way to see the kind of snow I'm used to seeing having
grown up here in New England (An hour away actually, we get even more
snow there.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the rant. Have a good day everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2007 14:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2007-12-19:ah-a-real-new-england-winter-now-if-only-people-could-cope.html</guid><category>cities</category><category>community</category><category>elderly</category><category>new england</category><category>side walks</category><category>snow</category><category>winter</category></item><item><title>One Blog, One Heart (Let's get together and feel alright!)</title><link>/one-blog-one-heart-lets-get-together-and-feel-alright.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;OK so I couldn't resist the Ziggy Marley reference :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a previous post on the old blog, I'm switching to
&lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, because, honestly,
&lt;a href="http://www.typosphere.org"&gt;Typo&lt;/a&gt; is a royal pain for anyone who isn't
already a top notch Ruby on Rails coder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please don't expect any more posts on the old link /
feed - You can get the new RSS feeds and all the other groovy info from
this (the new blog) hosted &lt;a href="http://www.feoh.org"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of note to my much appreciate LiveJournal readership - the original
idea was that I would keep an external geek blog and only cross post to
LJ when I had something not even remotely geeky to say. The truth is
that these days, I end up doing a lot of work that I find personally
exciting and fulfilling, but that the world at large wouldn't. So, I've
enabled the LiveJournal cross poster that Wordpress supplies and hence
can stop thinking about where to post what. I hope my LJ friends will
tolerate skipping the occasionally geeky post when I *do* have
something of note to say :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep the old blog up in case someone wishes to Google some nugget
of wisdom from it (Yes, I know using Google as a verb is suspect, but
really, it could be much, much worse.) and ask my few but faithful
readers to please update their feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks and happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2007 08:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2007-12-19:one-blog-one-heart-lets-get-together-and-feel-alright.html</guid><category>blog</category><category>change</category><category>feeds</category><category>livejournal</category><category>typo</category><category>wordpress</category></item><item><title>Ah, Sweet Sanity!</title><link>/ah-sweet-sanity.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Woo. So, as I indicated in my old blog, I have switched to Wordpress.
Typo is nifty and all, but it's still hackerware and seems unlikely to
veer from that course any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as I love Ruby, I am still clueless about Rails and truthfully,
even web development in general (I have now learned the basics of CSS -
but apparently not enough to be dangerous yet, and I *still* don't
know Javascript.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress does everything I need with a modicum of hassle, so that's the
direction I'm moving in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does mean you'll need to update your RSS links. The new link is
here: http://www.feoh.org/?feed=rss2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However being Wordpress, it also supports Atom, and a bunch of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, look for more and more interesting bits in this space now that I
can stop wrestling with the infrastructure and actually say something
for a change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas, Happy (belated!) Channukah, and a happy new year!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">feoh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2007 11:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2007-12-18:ah-sweet-sanity.html</guid><category>blog</category><category>conversion</category><category>pain</category><category>sanity</category><category>typo</category><category>wordpress</category></item></channel></rss>
