engineer for a thoroughly awesome company -
&lt;a href="http://www.carbonite.com" title="Carbonite"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt;. Note that my opinions
are mine and not my employers (That should go without saying, but

&lt;a href="http://www.getchef.com" title="Chef"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever other tools I can
get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;

severe case of bibliophilia which I've had to throttle back quite a bit
now that I'm sharing my life with someone. Thankfully, she's very
understanding :), and dabbling in digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
