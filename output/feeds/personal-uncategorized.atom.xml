&lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedly is what Reader wanted to be when it grew up, but never had the
chance to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case anyone out there reading this is thinking "Google What?" -
here's the skinny.  If you find yourself reading a lot of websites on a
regular basis, constantly checking back to keep up to date with the
latest, you REALLY want a feed reader like this.  With something like
this, you can treat them all as if you were browsing articles in a
newspaper or magazine, either slavishly reading every one or, as I do,
cherry picking what most piques your interest from the stream (or
firehose as we geeks like to refer to it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I love about &lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com" title="Feedly"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard commands for everything - I'm a mouse hater from way back.
     Force me to click at your peril :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple views - I can either view my stream the good old fashioned
    way like Reader used to do - just a big old list of text headlines,
    or like a newspaper with photos front and center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 'Must Read' setting for the 1% of blogs I really don't want to
    miss a single post from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A truly superb mobile app! Can't overstate how important this is.
     The iPad and iPhone apps are optimized for that format, yet as
    feature-ful as the desktop.  Major win! (Reader sucked at this,
    using it on the go was paaaainful.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laziness - if you already use Reader as I did, all your feeds import
    seamlessly into Feedly, and while Reader still breathes, Feedly
    keeps it up to date so there's zero risk in giving it a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OK I know I already mentioned the mobile experience but the iPhone
    app deserves special mention, it makes it *so* easy to browse my
    feeds on the go, marking articles I actually want to read in-depth
    for later perusal via one of my other faves,
    &lt;a href="http://www.getpocket.com" title="Pocket"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Seriously, mad props
to the folks at &lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com" title="Feedly"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; for evolving
the state of the art, giving me a seamless migration path, and generally
taking an OK but generally pretty lackluster experience and elevating it
to joy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And no, I'm not being paid by these guys, I'm just wild about the
product.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="articles"></category><category term="feedly"></category><category term="feeds"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="information"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="reader"></category><category term="rss"></category></entry></feed>
