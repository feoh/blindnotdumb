more and more of an issue...&lt;!--more--&gt;As I get older, I find my need
for sleep decidedly increasing. Not so much the amount of sleep, that
has remained relatively stagnant at around 6 hours minimum (with a
minimum of 1 or 2 8+ hour nights thrown in for good measure) but the
degree to which the lack of the required sleep effects me and my ability
to do my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I could pull two or three all nighters in a week
with virtually no ill effects. Now, a night with 4 or 5 hours sleep, or
a night where my sleep is disturbed by something or other has a real and
noticeable effect on me the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know all the excess weight I'm carrying around isn't helping, and
hence I've been exercising religiously, burning about 300 calories per
session, which has definitely begun making a dent in my overall weight
(I won't mention numbers yet for fear of jinxing it. I find it's best
not to talk progress until I've lost a truly significant amount of and
kept it off for a while.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a treadmill and an exercise bike about 6 months ago now, and
those have been invaluable. The ability to exercise at home at my own
convenience means I can stumble out of bed, down the stairs, and onto
the treadmill so that before I ever have the chance to talk myself out
of it, I'm on the treadmill or the bike chugging away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thankfully things are moving in a positive direction. I just have to
keep at it, not fall off the horse (again having the equipment in the
house eliminates a myriad of excuses!) and be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's heartening for me to see a bunch of the younger folks I work with
decidedly not falling into the same trap many geeky people from my
generation were bitten by. They're incredibly health conscious, and
pretty much all have incredibly rigorous work out regimens and are
scrupulous about tracking their weight (One guy has his bathroom scale
broadcast his current weight to his Twitter feed. Think I'll pass on
that one, thanks :)). I know we've all heard the saw about establishing
good habits early, but in this case it can't be emphasized enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, pardon the slightly unfocused ramble, but this stuff has been
rattling around my head wanting to be written for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone's enjoying their summer!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="aging"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="exercise"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="sleep"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Green Mountains on My Mind</title><link href="/green-mountains-on-my-mind.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-10-14T17:19:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2010-10-14:green-mountains-on-my-mind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife and I enjoyed a long weekend vacation in Vermont a few days
back...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have noticed over time is that nothing leaves me relaxed in
quite the same way as a vacation to Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it has to do with more than just the majestic green mountain
views, fresh air, and locally sourced fresh food. It's a state of mind,
one which embraces an aesthetic that pervades everything and is a
conscious decision on the part of its participants to build in ways that
harmonize with the natural landscape rather than paving over and
obliterating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, we visited the &lt;a href="http://www.woodstockmagazineonline.com/2010/09/woodstock-apples-crafts-fair/" title="Woodstock Apples &amp;amp; Crafts Fair | Woodstock Magazine"&gt;Woodstock Apple and Crafts
Fair&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="http://www.craftproducers.com/festival-details.php?id=31" title="Craft Producers"&gt;Stowe Foliage Arts
Festival&lt;/a&gt;.
The artisans displaying their wares were really quite amazing. This is
not your average New England craft show with 9000 booths of knit
scarves. These festivals had woodworoking, blown and stained glass,
metal smiths, leatherworkers, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No trip to Vermont (for us anyway :) would be complete without a stop at
&lt;a href="http://www.alchemistbeer.com/" title="The Alchemist Pub And Brewery"&gt;The
Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;
in Waterbury. These folks have some of the best craft brewed beer I've
ever tasted. This time I got to sample their new 'Wee Heavy' - a super
malty dark brew called 'The Wee Little Wabbit' - yum! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about retiring there in our dottage, and I've got to say
I'm definitely up for it. Hopefully we can retire young enough to be
able to actually enjoy it :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="artisans"></category><category term="arts"></category><category term="beer"></category><category term="crafts"></category><category term="fairs"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="green mountains"></category><category term="mountains"></category><category term="outdoors"></category><category term="scenery"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="trees"></category><category term="vacation"></category><category term="Vermont"></category><category term="woods"></category></entry><entry><title>Face, meet Mr. Concrete wall.</title><link href="/face-meet-mr-concrete-wall.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-29T15:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2010-06-29:face-meet-mr-concrete-wall.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned here previously, my last big job search after I got laid
off from MIT was decidedly Not Fun...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up taking a job I would normally never take, because I felt
utterly backed up against a wall by the economy, increasing competition
in the tech sector, and the big skeleton rattling around in my closet -
the lack of a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got turned down by 2 or 3 prospective employers because of this, which
is something that hasn't happened to me for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I took said job, I steeled myself for the worst and called my
old school, Worcester State College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was not at all what I was expecting. I &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; only need
two courses to get my bachelors degree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got all the paperwork filled out, jumped through all the necessary
hoops and found out that I (still) need a science, and a science with a
lab in order to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That information in hand, I went casting around for a science course I
could take. Not easy, many of them required calculus, and those that
didn't hab lab periods smack dab in the middle of my work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one course, Astronomy, that only claimed to require College
Algebra and was taught Tuesday and Thursday evenings. So, I leapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course started a week and a half ago. Since that time, I have poured
\~30 hours and a number of sleepless nights into it, and unfortunately I
have to admit that there is eactly zero chance of my passing this
course. No amount of effort, lack of sleep, or heroics short of quitting
my job (Freaking unlikely since I'm INCREDIBLY happy where I am now. I
escaped from Windows enterprise hell and am working for an amazing
company, &lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/"&gt;Blue State Digital&lt;/a&gt;.) will
save me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been expecting the math to kick my ass, but in the end analyais, I
could handle that just fine! There wasn't a single bit of algebraic
manipulation I couldn't get past with a little work and some Google
thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the formulas! Crazy, INSANE formulas crawling across the page and
eating my poor addled brain like some kind of scene out of Dawn of the
Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F~ev~ / F~em~ = ( G M~v~ M~e~ / R~ev~^2^ ) / ( G M~m~ M~e~ / R~em~^2^)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to withdraw from the battlefiend this time - I've lost the
skirmish, but I am bound and determined to win the war!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take some time to recover, take a fresh look at the problem, and
talk to my academic advisor to see if I can apply some 'life credit' or
something, or at the very least not bludgeon myself senseless over my
lack of higher math, so I can finish up the silly degree and get on with
my life!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="astronomy"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="courses"></category><category term="degree"></category><category term="goals"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="math"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Aruba - Take 2</title><link href="/aruba-take-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-12T12:36:00+00:00</updated><author><name>cpatti</name></author><id>tag:,2009-10-12:aruba-take-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just (well, a week ago, but work was blazing white hot upon my return,
so no time to write :) got back from a week in Aruba, and my experience
this time around was &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; different...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_52" align="alignnone" width="225"

Aruba!" src="http://www.feoh.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/photo-225x300.jpg" title="GreetingsFromAruba" /&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we rented a time share my wife's boss graciously allowed us
to occupy at well below market rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was positively awesome.  We were at the &lt;a href="http://www.playalinda.com/" title="Playa Linda Time Share"&gt;Playa
Linda&lt;/a&gt; time share,
sandwiched between some of the better hotels along the beach (We had the
Westin on one side, and the Hyatt, Radison, Occidental and finally the
Taj/Ritz on the other.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always been rather down on time sharing - who wants to go to the
same place every year? Well, my eyes have been opened.  We're not about
to go running to buy one (We still want to visit a bunch more places
first) but I can now absolutely see settling down someplace that you
love to come back to every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit we rented was very nice.  You get a separate sleeping area, a
nice little living room with 2 couches (one fold out in case you have
guests) and a decent size LCD TV.  The kitchenette is equipped with
everything you'd need to keep house for a week - pots, pans, dishes,
silverware, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had amazing weather while we were there, it was in the 90's most of
the time, but with those trade marked Aruban trade winds, it didn't feel
opressively hot at all (Though you really have to watch out for the
tropical sun, it can kick your butt :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach where we were sat in between two piers, so there's no terrible
rip tide threatening to pull you out to sea.  The sand is coral, rather
than granite based like the beaches in NH around here, so it's silky
smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent our days going from pool to beach, seeing the sights on the
island and having dinner either with our hosts (who graciously cooked
two amazing meals for us while we were there) or taking advantage of
some of the excellent restaurants on the island like &lt;a href="http://www.madamejanette.info/" title="Madame Jeanette's"&gt;Madame
Jeanette's&lt;/a&gt; - it's a
uniquely Caribbean restaurant in that the seating is largely outdoors. 
If you visit the island, that's definitely one not to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I'd taken a camera other than my iPhone along with us (I kept it
in the room most of the time for fear it would melt :) there was
wildlife everythere.  Sand Pipers, Turns, and Iguanas were all sharing
the pool and beach with us, which my wife and I enjoyed immensely (Some
other guests not so much, people get freaked out by lizards for some
reaosn :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was a week of utter fun and relaxation in the sun, and we'll
definitely be back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="aruba"></category><category term="beach"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="tropical"></category><category term="vacation"></category></entry><entry><title>So, I landed in China Town!</title><link href="/so-i-landed-in-china-town.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-06-12T19:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2009-06-12:so-i-landed-in-china-town.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been forever and a day since I posted here. I apologize for the
fade, my 4 or 5 readers must be thinking I'd joined the silent masses of
bloggers who can't overcome the inertia and fail to post ever again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chinatown Gate
Small" src="http://www.feoh.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/chinatown-gate-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I described in my last post, January was not the best of months for
me, and neither was February for that matter. After the layoff, I
launched into the job search with zeal and quickly remembered (It's like
riding the bike :) the familiar rhythms of the horse and pony show that
is any job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely work to be had out there, but much of it was well
outside the city, only barely accessible via a bus line that dropped me
into the middle of a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; pedestrian unfriendly industrial park.
Eek. I interviewed a lot, and even had a close call at MIT but in the
end analysis they had further cuts and couldn't hire for the job for
another month or so which put me out of the running - I have a hungry
mortgage to feed after all :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, a recruiter from a company I'd never heard of before - &lt;a href="http://www.trizetto.com/" title="The Trizetto Group"&gt;The
Trizetto Group&lt;/a&gt; called
and said they were very interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're a Windows shop, which initially made me shy away from the idea,
but they do a LOT of Perl for their core process automation stuff which
I'm reasonably fluent in, and it would be an opportunity for a total
technology reboot - not something one gets a lot of chances to do in
one's career. So I interviewed there a couple of times and it worked
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, it's been really great. They're right across from the
Chinatown gate in the picture above, so I can just hop on the bus
outside my door for a short ride to Sullivan Station T, then another
reasonably short subway ride to the Chinatown stop on the Orange Line.
I've been enjoying the chance to explore Chinatown more fully. Where
else can you stop off at the market next door before work and grab a can
of white fungus drink, or some dried cuttlefish snack? (Why you would
&lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to is a different matter altogether, though I do enjoy the
cuttlefish :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work has been exciting and challenging as well. I was really,
&lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; out of touch with the modern Windows environment. My last
real experience working in depth with it was back in the Windows NT 4.0
and Windows 98 era and it has come a long, &lt;strong&gt;LONG&lt;/strong&gt; way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hours have been long at times (I joined toward the end of a release
cycle and it's a major crunch) but I've been learning a &lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; about
Installshield, .Net, ASP.Net, Powershell, the registry, and in general
the vagaries of working in the Windows environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting that everyone should ditch the comfort of their Linux
or Mac environments. Heck, if I had my druthers I'd be hacking on one of
those for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, many geeks (and I was very much guilty of this) have
institutionalized the hatred of all things Microsoft, and in so doing
have had their heads in the sand for so long that they've failed to
notice a truly powerful environment evolving out of the muck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get off my soapbox now. I guess that's about it - life is generally
pretty good. There are times when I wish I could be spending time with
my lovely wife or my friends, but I'd rather deal with that than the
alternative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I'll have something of substance to say again soon. Stay
tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="boston"></category><category term="Chinatown"></category><category term="downtown"></category><category term="job"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>A Short, Sharp Shock</title><link href="/a-short-sharp-shock.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-19T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2009-02-19:a-short-sharp-shock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One morning a few weeks back I was told to get in early to meet about an
upcoming release that was happening...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we were in for a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of my co-workers and I were laid off that morning, along with 23
other unlucky souls from different parts of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense I can understand the necessity for this kind of overt
deception - there are certainly a non trivial number of people who would
not react well to "Hey, be sure to be in by X time, because we're doing
lay offs and we don't want your tardiness to clog up the gears!", but I
can't help but feel there has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason this one was a bit harder than most for me to accept,
because I loved working at the Broad and had no desire to leave. I don't
harbor any ill will against anyone over it - everyone was just doing
their jobs, and in truth save for my misgivings about leading lambs to
the slaughter like that, I think everyone handled the whole process with
a great deal of professionalism, which is all anyone can ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of working with a bunch of incredibly bright,
talented, friendly people for 4 years. In high tech that's a pretty good
run actually!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm doing the job search thing again. I chose to eschew the job
placement seminars and such they'd set up for us - I know how to polish
my resume and how to interview, and to my mind that 2 or three days was
much better spent trying to find a soft place for myself to land while
the incredible shrinking job market vaporized before my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been very lucky, things are actually going very well thus far -
I've had 2 first round interviews and one 2nd round, with another set
for today, and two more first round interviews set for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we'll see where all of this leads me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say enough about how amazing my wife has been through all of
this - I'm a very lucky guy indeed :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Broad"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="job"></category><category term="layoff"></category><category term="MIT"></category><category term="search"></category></entry><entry><title>INSUFFERABLE CUTENESS!</title><link href="/insufferable-cuteness.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-04T16:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-10-04:insufferable-cuteness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[ Note: Adorable Golden retriever picture behind the cut. ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and friends put on a really incredible party. They went over
the top decorating our house - it was beautiful. Everyone who came
seemed to have a wonderful time, and I enjoyed myself tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party aside though, it's interesting how (for me anyway, other people
differ I'm sure) birthdays that end in zero inevitably engender a kind
of check pointing. An opportunity to step back, try to take an objective
look at things, and say to ones self "Am I where I want to be, and if
not, how can I get there?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely a bunch of personal challenges I intend to take on
over the next decade (Around things like self discipline and career
direction) but on the whole I am exactly where I wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amazes me that &lt;strong&gt;10 years&lt;/strong&gt; have flown by since I turned 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I was much less happy and well adjusted at that point,
and there were many things in my life I wanted and needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was beginning to see foreshadows of certain decisions I had made and
paths I was treading down, but didn't have enough confidence in my own
instincts and intuition to take evasive action before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few years for things to spiral down to (for me) rock bottom
and then, once I made the tough changes that needed making, another
couple of years to enjoy the healthy bachelor life and truly recover,
but by thirty seven / thirty eight I had met my wife, and things have
gotten steadily (and dramatically!) better since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I look back across the last decade, I can't help but be reminded
of how lucky I am. I have enjoyed the support of friends and
acquaintances near and far. Each of them has contributed in some
meaningful way to who I am today, Thanks, everybody! It's been quite a
trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next decade!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="40"></category><category term="age"></category><category term="birthday"></category><category term="friends"></category><category term="growth"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="time"></category></entry><entry><title>The Xbox 360 has landed!</title><link href="/the-xbox-360-has-landed.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-04T15:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-08-04:the-xbox-360-has-landed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have suffered as much pain and heaped as much hatred in Redmond's
general direction as the next battle hardened veteran geek, but man,
this console is home entertainment done right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of box hook up couldn't possibly be any easier. Plug the power
brick into the wall and the Xbox360, plug the HDMI cable into your TV,
plug the ethernet cable into your network and away you go. It's that
simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network setup was beyond trivial - the unit set itself up properly
despite my somewhat complex home network configuration (I have a Linksys
and a Buffalo wifi router both running WDS, one doing NAT duties for the
house) and was talking to Xbox Live and downloading updates immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the Elite model, with the 120GB HD, so it comes with 'auto
download' turned on. I rather like this (Some would find it annoying I'm
sure) as it means that my console is pre-seeded with all the latest
demos so I can play all the hot new games to get an idea of what they're
like before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wow, the picture quality with this thing and a nice HD set is
impressive. I'm finding that video from the XB360 looks much better than
HD video from cable (I'm guessing this is a result of the compression I
keep hearing that cable companies like Comcast use.). I only have
Bioshock and Mass Effect thus far, and that they look amazing probably
goes without saying given the hype around them before and after their
release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the XB360 experience I'm rather fond of are 'zones' -
your choices are Recreational, Family, Pro, and Underground. This means
that folks like me who are exceedingly unlikely to spend 22 hours
straight playing Halo to hone their attack skills aren't pitted against
people who haven't seen the sun in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also surprised to see the depth and breadth of decidedly casual
games in the 'arcade' section, for people who eschew shooters and the
'temple of twitch' style of gaming.  Old board gaming standards like
Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, and Lost Cities are notable in their
presence, as well as a bunch of arcade classics I was pleased to see
being introduced to new generations of gamers (Like Gauntlet and Joust.

vivid memory of a really pleasant day many years ago...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in High School I think, and a friend of mine (He was my 'Big
Brother' actually, a program I was in for kids whose fathers weren't
around so we&lt;br /&gt;
could get some sense of what it's like to be a man - I think it only
partially worked :) ) and I were canoeing around &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=Lake+Dennison,&amp;amp;near=Templeton,+MA&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;view=text&amp;amp;latlng=9446610972854578859&amp;amp;dtab=0&amp;amp;ei=BLGISJHMJomKjAHY9bWhBw&amp;amp;oi=&amp;amp;sa=X#" title="Google Maps"&gt;Lake
Dennison&lt;/a&gt;
in Templeton, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been a lot of rain that year too, a LOT of rain, and the
lake's water level was threatening to swell over the top and flood the
beach entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
This made for some beautiful canoeing, since it allowed us to row down
a series of inlets which would normally have been almost totally
inaccessible&lt;br /&gt;
by foot because of the dense brush. It was just gorgeous out there, the
air smelled incredibly lush and green, and there were flowers and small
wild&lt;br /&gt;
life all around - we managed to get within perfect viewing distance of
a doe and her fawn before they pranced away, and we're pretty sure we
disturbed&lt;br /&gt;
the work of a beaver or two that wasn't at all used to the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's funny how when you get older (and I don't even mean ancient either,
just middle aged) memories can take on not just the rosy glow of years
long&lt;br /&gt;
past but a strange intensity all their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stink at canoeing, but I do hope I can go out rowing even on a row
boat or something again someday. I miss those quiet moments on the lake

friend and another friend of hers to Ireland...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the CIE 'A Taste of Ireland" bus tour, and had an amazing time.
This was my first trip to Europe, and unsurprisingly, I found it
amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland is definitely a party country, if there could be said to be such
a thing :) It seemed like there were Guinness taps everywhere. Being&lt;br /&gt;
rather a fan, this could hardly be considered a problem for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Guinness, on our first day we visited the Guinness brewery
in St. James Gate. The initial 'tour' is kind of neat, although mostly
just&lt;br /&gt;
multimedia presentations and the like about how it's made. The real
bonanza however, and the reason that I feel no Guinness fan should miss
a visit,&lt;br /&gt;
is the 'Gravity Bar' on the top floor of the brewery. You only get 1
pint of Guinness (probably to cut down on loitering and move people
through) but&lt;br /&gt;
I have to say it's the best pint I've ever tasted. Most of the other
pubs we visited had fine Guinness, but really it wasn't particularly any
more&lt;br /&gt;
tasty than a pint drawn at a really good pub here in the US that knows
how to handle its Guinness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus tour itself was incredible, but a bit grueling. A typical day
involved getting up at 6:30 to get to breakfast at 7:30 so we could pile
onto&lt;br /&gt;
the bus for 8:00. After that, it was a dizzying whirl wind of
destinations and picture taking, and usually around 5:30 in the evening
they'd dump&lt;br /&gt;
us at our destination where we'd be staying for the night, and we'd all
crawl away to freshen up and try to recover enough to enjoy the
evening's&lt;br /&gt;
festivities :) In addition to the sheer endurance required for the
trip, we definitely experienced the expected feeling that in a number of
cases,&lt;br /&gt;
we would have *REALLY* liked to have more time to explore (For
instance we never kissed the Blarney Stone because we had exactly 2.5
hours to&lt;br /&gt;
have lunch, explore the Blarney Woolen Mills, and visit Castle
Blarney!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't detail everything we saw, it would get boring for both of us and
there's no point - consult a good travel guide and you'll get better&lt;br /&gt;
writing than I can muster anyway. A couple of tidbits I particularly
enjoyed were seeing Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a stop we
made&lt;br /&gt;
at a working sheep farm (You have no idea what it actually sounds like
to have 1,000 sheep being herded :) ), and a buggy ride through
Kilarney&lt;br /&gt;
National Park with a stop at Castle Ross, whose ruins are still in
remarkably good shape allowing you to wander around, climb the ramparts,
and&lt;br /&gt;
generally get up close and personal in the kind of relaxed way I most
enjoy exploring a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talented wife took about a billion pictures - I took a few as well
but if you see the angle skewed oddly it's probably mine - she has a
real&lt;br /&gt;
eye for composition! You can look at them on

if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we'll go to Italy next year, if I don't convince her that a nice
relaxing sunny beach vacation on an island somewhere is the way to go :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="europe"></category><category term="fun"></category><category term="ireland"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="vacation"></category></entry><entry><title>Ireland trip, work business, general update stuff.</title><link href="/ireland-trip-work-business-general-update-stuff.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-07T23:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-05-07:ireland-trip-work-business-general-update-stuff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is one of those rare occasions when I have nothing more to say than
a brief status update...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life has been good, but &lt;strong&gt;busy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, the &lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org/" title="Maven - Welcome to Maven"&gt;Maven
2&lt;/a&gt; transition is
slated to happen this weekend. If we can carry it off successfully, I
will be able to trundle off across the pond with a giant weight lifted
from my shoulders as we've been working towards this for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of trundling off across the pond - We're headed to Ireland next
week. We're in that frenzied pre vacation phase where we're trying to
ensure that we take everything we need while still traveling
(comparatively) light. This is all very exciting for me, as it'll be my
first trip to Europe, and also my first international vacation as a
married man :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a tour, which honestly I was not entirely thrilled at the prospect
of at first (I tend to like to identify my own points of interest and
see them at my own pace) but I'm comforted by the idea that we'll be
spending a full two days at each destination so at least I don't have to
worry about being whisked from place to place in rapid fire succession
(I &lt;strong&gt;HATE&lt;/strong&gt; that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's all for now. More when I return :) Hope this note finds
everyone well!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="europe"></category><category term="ireland"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="vacation"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Another whirlwind weekend in Manhattan</title><link href="/another-whirlwind-weekend-in-manhattan.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-15T08:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-04-15:another-whirlwind-weekend-in-manhattan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was first and foremost a visit to spend time with my wife's
family...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But as always we managed to sneak some fun in between the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had brunch at &lt;a href="http://www.vynl-nyc.com/" title="Vynl Locations"&gt;Vynl&lt;/a&gt;. This
place is downright fun, from the records decorating the walls to the
album jacket menus to the bathrooms each with their own unique theme -
The Beatles, Madonna, etc. Happily, the brunch food is actually quite
good. We had and can enthusiastically recommend the banana pecan
pancakes, the brioche french toast, and the make your own omelette
option. The large glasses of tasty fresh squeezed orange juice are also
a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick stop at the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/week/20080413.html" title="Apple Store - Fifth Avenue"&gt;Manhattan Apple Store on Fifth
Avenue&lt;/a&gt;
and were amazed at the multi-national throng as we jostled our way in
only to decide that the shopping we'd hoped to do for a relative was
impossible, and found our way out again (The place was &lt;strong&gt;packed&lt;/strong&gt; -
hundreds of people at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day while trolling around for something to fill a couple of
idle hours, we ended up at the &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/listings/bar/king_cole_bar_lounge/" title="King Cole Bar Lounge - - Midtown East - New York Magazine Bar Guide"&gt;King Cole
Lounge&lt;/a&gt;
at the gorgeous and elegant &lt;a href="http://specialoffers.starwoodhotels.com/stregisnyc" title="St. Regis New York Hotels: The St. Regis New York - Hotel Rooms at stregis.com"&gt;St. Regis
Hotel&lt;/a&gt;.
If you're lucky enough to get a table (We only scored one due to the
generosity of a couple whose party unexpectedly shrank due to the
departure of some friends) you'll be treated to a viewing of a beautiful
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish" title="Maxfield Parrish - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;Maxfield
Parrish&lt;/a&gt;
mural depicting King Cole looking on bemusedly at the festivities. The
drinks are stiff, well made and very tasty, and the bar snacks are
unusually good. I had a Big Apple Manhattan and the ladies got
Pomegranate martinis which both got rave reviews. Apparently, the Red
Snapper cocktail they serve here is the ancestor to the modern &lt;a href="http://www.twoop.com/food_drink/archives/2005/10/bloody_mary_cocktail.html" title="Bloody Mary Cocktail Timeline and History"&gt;Bloody
Mary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having wiled away the aforementioned time in tipsy elegance, we made our
way over to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shunleepalace.com%2Fnewyork%2F&amp;amp;ei=vO4ESL3YFY7yecP24CI&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEEWKSfl83bO3oX2vVkKtUVqFI1Aw&amp;amp;sig2=IeMl8zEpihNS7h89isd5ug"&gt;Shun Li
Palace&lt;/a&gt;
where we met up with some other family for dinner. This is perhaps not
the most authentic Chinese food I've ever encountered, but wow is it
tasty. Also, the atmosphere is decidedly upscale. There is a significant
wine list, and the staff are decked out in full suit attire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between too many bar snacks and a lovely dinner, we waddled back to our
&lt;a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ic/1/en/hotel/nycha?&amp;amp;sitrackingid=11567879&amp;amp;sicreative=502516696&amp;amp;sicontent=0&amp;amp;firstpoint=dcb1&amp;amp;siclientid=1911&amp;amp;cm_mmc=Google-PS-InterContinental-_-G+B-AmericasEast-_-NY-NYC-_-intercontinental+barclay+nyc%7C-%7C100000000000002341259&amp;amp;gclid=CPCsq8vV3ZICFQGAHgodxzH5iw" title="InterContinental NEW YORK CITY Hotels | THE BARCLAY NEW YORK | Welcome"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;
(Yay Priceline. We'd never have stayed there otherwise) and passed out
in a happy blissful drink and dinner induced haze :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
