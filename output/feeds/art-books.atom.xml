&lt;p&gt;I received a piece of E-mail from Amazon a few days back apologizing
about the fact that my pre-order of the latest &lt;a href="www.jimbutcher.com"&gt;Jim
Butcher&lt;/a&gt; Dresden Files novel had been canceled,
offering me a really cheap price on the print edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days and a great deal of "WTF?" later (That's What The
French, this being a family friendly blog and all :) I trotted on over
to Jim's website and found an
&lt;a href="http://www.jim-butcher.com/news/000362.php"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Amazon and Penguin are bickering over the sale price of the
book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would *happily* pay full hard cover list for the Kindle edition of
the newest Dresden novel.Â  Jim Butcher is my favorite urban fantasy
author, and when these books come out I get them the very
first *instant* I can and then become some sort of literary crack
fiend, obsessively trying to find excuses to crawl off into a corner and
page flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

So I guess I'll run down to Porter Square Books and buy the dead tree
edition, but this is what I bought my Kindle for!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

On the up side, I've been feeling guilty about not supporting my local
independent book seller of late, I guess this is an opportunity to put
my money where my mouth is and pony up!

&lt;/div&gt;
