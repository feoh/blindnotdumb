engineer for a thoroughly awesome company -
&lt;a href="http://www.carbonite.com" title="Carbonite"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt;. Note that my opinions
are mine and not my employers (That should go without saying, but
anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create and manage build and other infrastructure for Carbonite using
&lt;a href="http://www.getchef.com" title="Chef"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever other tools I can
get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the off hours I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife, playing
games of all kinds (but especially those involving face to face human
interaction like board games or tabletop RPGs), reading (I have a rather
severe case of bibliophilia which I've had to throttle back quite a bit
now that I'm sharing my life with someone. Thankfully, she's very
understanding :), and dabbling in digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
