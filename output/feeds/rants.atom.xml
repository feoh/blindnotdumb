&lt;a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/introducing-new-compose-in-gmail.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that
they were releasing a new Composer for GMail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's awful.  They made the window small, and right justified it.  I feel
like I have to crane my neck at an unnatural angle in order to see what
I'm writing, and worse yet, they've turned my good old message
composition interface into something akin to a web forum or chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; what I'm looking for in my email user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, Google also did a full on revamp of the GMail UI that
utterly convinced me they have an unrelenting hatred of the visually
impaired. The entire screen looked as if it had been bleached of color
and life, and the contrast was so low I could literally barely read it
at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After squeals of protect from a large chunk of their user base, they
relented and produced a 'high contrast' setting, which was better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I can't keep feeling like I'm being punched full in the face
by Google every few months. I respect their right to innovate their
products in whatever way they see fit, but thankfully I don't have to
choose between liking it or hitting the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've switched to Apple's Mail.app and iCal. They work great, aren't
actively hostile to the visually impaired, and allow me to keep using
the Google back end so I can keep my old email addresses and contact
info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple may be many things, but one thing they are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; about is
providing accessibility features for the handicapped. It's not like I
have any illusions about being a minority - most people can probably
read the ghostly low contrast color theme just fine, and probably like
the fact that their email now looks more like IM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More power to them I say :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:  Can't lie, it's been a rough go.  Gmail's IMAP access
throttles throughput beyond a certain point, and Apple Mail can't handle
the large mailboxes I have even with having given them a serious slim
down.  I really wish there were a solution to this problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update Update: I've essentially given up on this :( Mail.app just plain
stinks.  It might be fine for folks with a single account or maybe very
light usage on multiple accounts, but with two Gmail accounts and lots
of labels, it's downright abysmal.  It takes 15-20 minutes to get
everything in sync, and then often takes another 20 minutes just to
&lt;strong&gt;exit the app!&lt;/strong&gt; This is not my idea of an enterprise class  eMail
application.  I'm disappointed in you Apple!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="email"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="handicapped"></category><category term="Macintosh"></category><category term="mail"></category><category term="UX"></category></entry><entry><title>Why NOT to vote for Scott Brown for MA Senate</title><link href="/why-not-to-vote-for-scott-brown-for-ma-senate.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-18T12:51:00+00:00</updated><author><name>cpatti</name></author><id>tag:,2010-01-18:why-not-to-vote-for-scott-brown-for-ma-senate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;

Like any civic minded person about to vote in tomorrow's MA senatorial
election tomorrow, I was browsing the candidates websites so I could
make an informed choice.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

I am honestly not the biggest Coakley fan, but given the two choices
she's a shining star compared to Scott Brown.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no issue with most of the points he puts forth in the "Issues"
section of his website, right up until we get to "Marriage" -
conveninetly located third from the bottom, just above "Israel" and
"Iran".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. States should be free to make their own laws in this area, so long as they reflect the people's will as expressed through them directly, or as expressed through their elected representatives. {style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of state's rights, but let's view this in context - here
in Massachusetts, same sex marriage is 100% legal.  If Mr. Brown is
elected, he will strip our state of one of its proudest moments in
recent memory, plunging us back into the darkness of ignorance,
discrimination and fear that has held sway since time immemorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a heterosexual man who has been blessed by the gift of marriage in my
life, I can't even begin to express how strongly I feel about this
issue.  To me, denying our fellow men and women this right because they
happen to be attracted to people of the same sex is so morally repugnant
as to be beyond words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not allow the army of small mindedness and ignorance to douse the
light of truth and plunge our fair state into darkness once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether straight, gay, yellow or purple, if you care about the basic
rights and freedoms that make our nation as great as it is, go vote
tomorrow, and vote against Scott Brown.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="civil rights"></category><category term="gay rights"></category><category term="marriage"></category><category term="massachusetts"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="same sex"></category><category term="senate"></category></entry><entry><title>The anti-political correctness backlash</title><link href="/the-anti-political-correctness-backlash.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-12-18T17:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>cpatti</name></author><id>tag:,2009-12-18:the-anti-political-correctness-backlash.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since when did "&lt;strong&gt;Happy Holidays"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; become persona non

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the blather out there about it being a self indulgent waste
of time, I think it's become pretty clear to anyone open minded enough
to actually wake up and smell the coffee that it's a communications
medium like any other, but one that lends itself to the dynamic, fast
paced nature of the modern world we live in. I personally find Twitter
useful on a number of levels, but first and foremost as a tool for the
dispersal of technical information to interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance I follow Guillaume Laforge, one of the designers of the
&lt;a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" title="The Groovy Programming Language"&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt;
programming language to see what's up with new releases of his software,
what he's up to, etc. I'm also following a number of members of the
&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/" title="Windows PowerShell"&gt;Windows
PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;
development team at Microsoft to get the inside scoop on that awesome
tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also follow Amanda Palmer, lead vocalist for The Dresden Dolls,
several authors, and a smattering of friends who've also been turned on
to Twitter, as well as some feeds around hobbies and interests of mine -
the &lt;a href="http://blog.paintermagazine.co.uk/" title="Corel Painter"&gt;Corel Painter&lt;/a&gt;
community has an incredibly vibrant Twitter presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that Twitter may have originally been about what people
are eating for lunch today, or that the train is late in coming and
they're stuck next to a guy who smells on the platform, but like most
things it has evolved and become something much more than the designers
originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this rather useful convention in the Twitter world called &lt;a href="http://tagdef.com/" title="hash tag definitions"&gt;hash
tags&lt;/a&gt; - things like
#powershell or #groovy or #redsox - these let people with particular
interests 'tune in' on related tweets whether or not they're already
following a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last week however I've begun to see a trend I really do not like.
Tags like &lt;a href="http://playspymaster.com/" title="Spymaster"&gt;#spymaster&lt;/a&gt; are being
used by people playing games that use Twitter and your followers as the
medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clutters up my Twitter feed, but more to the point, makes Twitter
much less usable and interesting for those who don't have and/or don't
want to &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; fancy clients that can filter out certain tags so they
won't be bothered by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, it's been a fantastic way
for me to get back in touch with a bunch of people I am really psyched
to be in contact with again, but as anyone with a lot of Facebook
friends and not a lot of time knows, the silly games and apps can get
quite chatty and &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; annoying awfully quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying anyone's doing anything wrong here - some of the apps are
fun and a couple are even useful or enlightening, but when you log in
and see 120 Little Green Plant requests, 50 Snowball requests, 40 Mixed
Drink requests, and 300 'Other' requests, it gets real old, real fast :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's my take on the matter. Let's keep Twitter as much signal as we
can, lest the noise overtake us and leave us drowning in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;

down shrilly screaming the facts as they claim to see them at the top of
their lungs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But real, verifiable facts are mightily hard to come by. I'm personally
rather conflicted on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my wife and I are serious dog people. She can spot a puppy at 500
yards in a bustling crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is getting all sorts of messages from the MSPCA and their ilk
claiming that the dogs are being horribly abused and that it must stop
RIGHT NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vote No on 3 contingent is mostly coming off sounding combative and
shrill as well. Their Boston Globe piece reminded me of conservative
talk radio - it might as well have been written by Rush Limbaugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks over at &lt;a href="http://protectdogsandjobs.org/" title="Vote NO on Massachusetts Question 3 - Protect Dogs and Our Jobs - Home"&gt;Protect Dogs and
Jobs&lt;/a&gt;
are citing the loss of 1,000 jobs and \$4 million in state revenue if
the ban passes, and claiming that the incidence of dog injury in the
sport is incredibly small (1 injury for every 1000 dogs racing -
something like .1%) and compare that to the injury stat for Girls
Volleyball which is at 1.47%. the only thing I keep hearing from these
folks about the abuse allegations is "Owners have every incentive to
treat their dogs well, so they'll race well" - but I'm not sure how well
that theory holds water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is right? Are the dogs actually being abused, or is this people
getting carried away with themselves on principle and ignoring the
actual facts of the matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a voter, it's a tough call. I have my mind pretty well made up on the
other two (No and yes respectively) but I'm very much on the fence with
this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any opinions on this? Or better yet any actual
experience with the way the dogs are treated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ Edit: November 3rd, tomorrow is E day :) My wife and I plan to hit the
polls early. I am no longer conflicted about this question, due to some
excellent responses I got on my LiveJournal and some tertiary research I
did as a result, I am now solidly in favor of the ban. I'm concerned
that dogs which participate in racing are adversely effected by this,
and their personalities are permanently damaged as a result. ]&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="3"></category><category term="ballot"></category><category term="ban"></category><category term="dogs"></category><category term="greyhound"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="questions"></category><category term="racing"></category></entry><entry><title>DEAD is dead!</title><link href="/dead-is-dead.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-18T05:47:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-08-18:dead-is-dead.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a rather 'meta' moment today after reading another article

What does she hope to gain? Is she so selfishly myopic that she's

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are deluding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find really troubling here is not the actual ban itself (I can't
think of the last time I bought a video game, much less a violent / gory
video game, inside Boston city limits) but instead another step in the
direction of absolving parents of the responsibility of raising their
children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All one has to do is simply look around at the scads of minors smoking
tobacco - a clear and present danger to anyone's health - to see that
government regulation is not the answer to what is in reality a social
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media has been making allusions about this being an attempt to
mitigate the recent rise in murders in the Boston area. I see this as a
cop out on the part of the mayor's office. Rather than attacking the
actual social problems at the root of this trend, they stand on the
highest mountain top and make a lot of noise while slapping an utterly
ineffective band aid over a sucking chest wound.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ban"></category><category term="boston"></category><category term="city"></category><category term="crime"></category><category term="gaming"></category><category term="laws"></category><category term="murder"></category><category term="problems"></category><category term="society"></category><category term="video games"></category><category term="violence"></category><category term="youth"></category></entry><entry><title>Genes, lifestyle, and longevity</title><link href="/genes-lifestyle-and-longevity.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-11T16:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-03-11:genes-lifestyle-and-longevity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I spent the weekend with my lovely wife and her family celebrating...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;her Nanna's 90th birthday. She had another uncle present who is 94 years
old and seems more spry and active than some thirty somethings I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to reflect a little bit on the fact that &lt;strong&gt;nobody&lt;/strong&gt; in my
family lives into their nineties, and damn few live into their eighties
(Or have thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that could readily explain this without
too much digging. My family has traditionally been lower middle class,
blue collar workers. As I've mentioned here before, my mom and dad meet
during WWII while working as mechanics repairing amphibious vehicles (My
dad was her foreman :). My uncles and cousins mostly worked in plastic
factories and the like, and all but the most recent generation smoked
all their (comparatively short) lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If longevity could be thought of as a graph with lifestyle, age and
genetics all expressed as axes, I wonder what our two families would
look like? Add in recent developments in the understanding of how
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt; effects
longevity and by extension how the environment and lifestyle of an
organism can effects its offspring one, two or even three or more
generations down the line, and you wind up with a dizzying
multi-dimensional data structure whose representation I can't even
fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda leaves me feeling grateful that we're not planning on having
children any time soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rant (meander? pile of babble? I dunno) has no conclusion per se.
Just a bunch of thoughts that have been rolling around in my head for a
bit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="aging"></category><category term="diet"></category><category term="exercise"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="genetics"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Usage peeves I have no business having</title><link href="/usage-peeves-i-have-no-business-having.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-15T14:25:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2008-01-15:usage-peeves-i-have-no-business-having.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am at best a poor writer.

    "teh" again, I will be a happy man.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Just sayin'. This may have been effective about 20 years ago when
    the first person who propagated this
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" title="Meme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;,
    but now it's tired. So &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; tired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics" title="Ebonics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;ebonics&lt;/a&gt; -
    I like rap. A good friend many years ago in college walked up to me
    one day when I was ranting at some friends about how I thought rap
    was just chaotic noise and nothing else, and said "Rap is one of the
    most politically active forms of music on the planet, and that's a
    fact.". He was right. All that's beside the point though, ebonics
    are seeping their way into main stream speech in ways I find most
    unfortunate. It can stop any time now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wassssssuupppppp!!! - the original Bud marketing campaign was
    brilliant, and even funny in spots (I still enjoy the sushi bar
    version - Wasabii!!!) but this meme is so tired it needs to be taken
    out back and shot - a mercy kill at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling everyone "Kid" whether they be 18 or 80 - Maybe the denizens
    of Southie can get grand fathered in on this one, I dunno, but the
    rest of you should really stop watching those Martin Scorsese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, I realize that in truth I have no business at all
airing my English usage peeves, because in truth I am a sloppy writer
and a downright poor grammarian. But anyway, I feel better having gotten
them off my chest :).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="english"></category><category term="language"></category><category term="memes"></category><category term="peeves"></category><category term="usage"></category></entry><entry><title>Ah, a real New England Winter. Now if only people could cope.</title><link href="/ah-a-real-new-england-winter-now-if-only-people-could-cope.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-19T14:18:00+00:00</updated><author><name>feoh</name></author><id>tag:,2007-12-19:ah-a-real-new-england-winter-now-if-only-people-could-cope.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every year, when the first &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; snow storm hits, people allow the
media to whip them into a fine frothy frenzy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never cease to be amazed at this phenomenon. You would think that the
hundreds of thousands of people who live here year in year out would get
the hint, see the pattern, clue in, or something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual rounds of closures, hubbub and horrendous
traffic jams (Induced by said closures and media frency) people also
somehow managge to forget, ignore, or otherwise avoid the simple
expedient of shoveling their side walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is exacerbated by absentee land lords who write clauses like
"Tenant is in charge of snow removal" into their lease (Which I'm told
is of questionable legality to begin with, but I'm hardly a lawyer so I
dunno). Your average college kid simply isn't going to feel motivated by
a sense of civic duty enough to get his/her butt out there on a winter's
day and start shoveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that there was a time when, if you didn't shovel your walk,
you would be fined by the city. I whole heartedly approve of this
practice and wish they'd bring it back. If you are elderly, infirm, or
otherwise unable to shovel your walk, you should hire someone to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't afford it, I would question whether or not you should be
owning property. This is somewhat harsh, but the truth is that when you
own a house in the city, you are sharing space with the rest of us, and
some responsibilities to the community come with that. Elder care and
charity should help pitch in for those truly needy cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on a positive note - aside from the impassable, icy sidewalks, I
am actually very much enjoying this winter. It's almost a relief in a
weird sort of way to see the kind of snow I'm used to seeing having
grown up here in New England (An hour away actually, we get even more
snow there.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the rant. Have a good day everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cities"></category><category term="community"></category><category term="elderly"></category><category term="new england"></category><category term="side walks"></category><category term="snow"></category><category term="winter"></category></entry></feed>
