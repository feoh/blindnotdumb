&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the fact that WordPress automatically updates itself helps
&lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, but it does lead one to wonder if a simpler solution might
make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of a static generator tool
like &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, but also really enjoy
blogging from my mobile devices with tools
like &lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com/"&gt;Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend suggested using Pelican, and using Github's built-in editor
to create the Markdown, so I suppose I should explore that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would &lt;strong&gt;really &lt;/strong&gt;love to see is a solution where I could compose
on my mobile devices in Markdown, then somehow get those changes checked
into Github so I could statically generate my blog later from a
computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I want everything :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A middle of the road solution might be to simply give up and
let &lt;a href="http://wordpress.com"&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; manage my blog, but I think
it's helpful to keep some skin in the game and run my own site given
that I build infrastructure for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone reading this has any amazing solutions to the problems I pose
here I'd love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 11:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2015-05-21:oh-wordpress-i-love-you-but-you-make-it-so-hard.html</guid><category>blogging</category><category>blogs</category><category>IPad</category><category>mobile</category><category>pelican</category><category>wordpress</category><category>writing</category></item><item><title>GNU Terry Pratchett</title><link>/gnu-terry-pratchett.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, pretty much the entire geek/fandom community was in full on
mourning over the death of fantasy author &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" title="Terry Pratchett"&gt;Terry
Pratchett&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was incredibly prolific, authoring scores of books, but nearest and
dearest to my heart are his
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld"&gt;Discworld&lt;/a&gt; books and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens"&gt;Good
Omens&lt;/a&gt; which he co-authored
with another of my favorite writers, &lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/"&gt;Neil
Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death was no surprise to anyone as he had made his fight with
Alzheimer's public, but that doesn't make his loss any less keenly felt
by his fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response his fans created the &lt;a href="http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/"&gt;GNU Terry
Pratchett&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't repeat the superb explanation the site gives (Go take a look,
it'll cost you maybe 30 seconds and is really quite delightful :) but
suffice it to say we geeks can be fairly inventive about remembering our
dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that whenever you read my blog you will, in some small
whimsical way, be honoring his memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIP Terry Pratchett.  I will be laughing out loud while reading your
work for some years to come :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 09:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2015-03-24:gnu-terry-pratchett.html</guid><category>books</category><category>fandom</category><category>fantasy</category><category>geeks</category><category>memorial</category><category>technology</category></item><item><title>The Joy of DevOps (Or, Return of the Living Generalist!)</title><link>/the-joy-of-devops-or-return-of-the-living-generalist.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I have always enjoyed about what I do is that I have,
from pretty much day 1 in the technology industry, worn many hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what my job title said, I have always done pretty much
whatever needs doing whether or not it crosses into what others might
consider a discipline that's not in my job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it that way. I enjoy picking up new skills, flexing my mental
muscles in new ways and exploring the uncharted territory that is every
new technology to rise out of the primordial ooze of Github (Or
Sourceforge before it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in 1992 when I got my first job in the technology industry, I
met a very wise man named Dale Dougherty (I hope I'm not mangling the
spelling, it's been over two decades! (If you're out there Dale, give me
a holler will you? I'd love to get back in touch) and when he asked what
it was that had driven me into technology, and after I told him in the
naescent, halting terms I could form at the time he smiled and said "Ah!
You're a generalist. Unfortunately, those are undervalued these days.
It's a great shame" or something to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy was he right. For the next 20 years I would end up doing tech
support, sysadmin work, software development, and finally release
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry began throwing up high walls and fences around places
and processes we all used to take for granted.  "You can't do that,
you're not a &lt;strong&gt;developer&lt;/strong&gt;!" "Only &lt;strong&gt;sysadmins&lt;/strong&gt; get root and access to
production machines!" "You're a &lt;strong&gt;release engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, not a developer!"
Ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2009 when folks came up with the DevOps manifesto, in
which a positively radical idea is proposed: All these distinctions are
useless. They do nothing to make organizations more efficient, and
instead bottleneck and pigeon hole good people, keeping them from
feeding their passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I love it here. I get to bring all the experience
I've accumulated in 20 years hard labor in the code mines to bear, and
it feels &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm building infrastructure in the cloud, learning about load
balancing, high availability and I've just barely begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as the layoff I just went through was painful as they always
are, that moment of dislocation pales in comparison to the satisfaction
I feel in what I have accomplished in the few short months I've been
doing this, and the &lt;strong&gt;incredible&lt;/strong&gt; excitement I feel as my horizons have
been exponentially broadened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I'm several thousand feet up, bouncing along over the
clouds on my way to Santa Clara, California for the annual Velocity
conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an incredible meeting where some of the best and brightest in our
industry come together to make the web go faster and more reliably, and
I can't wait to dive in and start learning :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Update: I'm posting this weeks later, because things get hectic. Such
is life. Velocity was amazing.  Look for another post on that coming
soon.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 16:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-07-31:the-joy-of-devops-or-return-of-the-living-generalist.html</guid><category>career</category><category>development</category><category>devops</category><category>engineering</category><category>generalist</category><category>releng</category><category>sysadmin</category><category>work</category></item><item><title>Dear Amazon and Penguin - Why Can't You Kids Play Nice?</title><link>/dear-amazon-and-penguin-why-cant-you-kids-play-nice.html</link><description>&lt;!-- body {margin:8px} .LW-yrriRe {font:normal x-small arial} --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a piece of E-mail from Amazon a few days back apologizing
about the fact that my pre-order of the latest &lt;a href="www.jimbutcher.com"&gt;Jim
Butcher&lt;/a&gt; Dresden Files novel had been canceled,
offering me a really cheap price on the print edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days and a great deal of "WTF?" later (That's What The
French, this being a family friendly blog and all :) I trotted on over
to Jim's website and found an
&lt;a href="http://www.jim-butcher.com/news/000362.php"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Amazon and Penguin are bickering over the sale price of the
book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would *happily* pay full hard cover list for the Kindle edition of
the newest Dresden novel.  Jim Butcher is my favorite urban fantasy
author, and when these books come out I get them the very
first *instant* I can and then become some sort of literary crack
fiend, obsessively trying to find excuses to crawl off into a corner and
page flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

So I guess I'll run down to Porter Square Books and buy the dead tree
edition, but this is what I bought my Kindle for!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

On the up side, I've been feeling guilty about not supporting my local
independent book seller of late, I guess this is an opportunity to put
my money where my mouth is and pony up!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2010 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-04-07:dear-amazon-and-penguin-why-cant-you-kids-play-nice.html</guid><category>amazon</category><category>books</category><category>dresden files</category><category>jim butcher</category><category>kindle</category><category>pricing</category><category>stupid</category><category>urban fantasy</category></item><item><title>Windows Scripting - a VBScript Survival Guide</title><link>/windows-scripting-a-vbscript-survival-guide.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're new to the world of Windows scripting as I am, the array of
acronyms, technologies and access methodologies that you need to
traverse in order to get anything done can range from bewildering on a
good day to utterly derangement inducing on a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been doing installer and deployment development at a Windows
enterprise software company for the last year or so, and after decades
spent comfortably swaddled in the familiarity of the UNIX and Java
world, I definitely found myself feeling shell shocked, disoriented, and
frustrated at the lack of any sort of cohesive resources to aid me in my
quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been doing its best to pretend VBScript doesn't exist -
touting &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/PowerShell/" title="Windows PowerShell"&gt;Windows
PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; as
the way and the light.  PowerShell is indeed an awesome tool, and I for
one would happily consign VBScript to the briny deeps never to be
thought of again were it not for one little problem - the vast majority
of Windows systems running in the wild don't have PowerShell
installed.   Until a new day dawns and PowerShell is on *every single*
Windows box our company wants to install its software on, VBScript
remains the lowest common denominator for system scripting and thus the
only &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; game in town for install time scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is not to teach you VBScript, sadly, there are
essentially no books and precious few online resources dedicated to this
topic online.  I will offer pointers to those that I have found most
useful, and some collected wisdom on how to best make use of them, as
well as some pitfalls I encountered which with any luck I can help you
avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Learning VBScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will mostly be a collection of pointers to resources with a smidgen
of commentary on each to get you moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-XP-Annoyances-Geeks-2nd/dp/0596008767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270065442&amp;amp;sr=8-1" title="Windows XP Annoyances"&gt;Windows XP
    Annoyances&lt;/a&gt; -
    This book should really be titled "Windows For Geeks" :) it is the
    single most useful book I have ever encountered for someone trying
    to make the transition from another environment and isn't content to
    just grit their teeth and groan at all the annoying defaults Windows
    ships with.  In addition to an incredible amount of depth around the
    Windows registry and how you can wield it to suit your needs, this
    book also has one of the best simple introductions to system
    scripting with VBScript I've seen.  Two thumbs up. Note that this is
    the 1997 edition, and this book now comes in Windows Vista and
    Windows 7 flavors which I haven't read, but can only assume are
    equally awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.visualbasicscript.com/" title="VBScript Forums"&gt;visualbasicscript.com&lt;/a&gt; -
    This is far and away the single best VBScript resources on the
    intertubes.  The folks in these forums are experts, and will help
    you solve your problem virtually every time.  I can't say enough
    about the incredible community here.  Nine out of ten times, if I go
    looking somewhere else first I end up coming back here and wishing I
    hadn't wasted my time elsewhere first :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/default.aspx" title="The Scripting Guys"&gt;Microsoft Script Center / The Scripting
    Guys&lt;/a&gt; -
    The second most useful scripting site on the web.  The Scripts
    Repository and "Scripting Guys" MSDN blog are an incredible resource
    for system scripters.  While the emphasis has definitely shifted
    towards PowerShell these days (and rightfully so) most of the
    techniques discussed can be leveraged in VBScript once you get cozy
    with the syntactic differences between the two (very different)
    languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d1et7k7c%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"&gt;MSDN Windows Scripting
    Technologies&lt;/a&gt; -
    This page covers things like the Windows Scripting Host, the core
    technology that actually allows you to perform useful work in
    VBScript.  While somewhat more complete than the VBScript reference
    itself, it's no great shakes.  You'll find yourself learning much
    more from examples published elsewhere, but for the occasional API
    lookup or clarification it can be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t0aew7h6%28VS.85%29.aspx" title="VBScript Reference"&gt;MSDN VBscript
    Reference&lt;/a&gt; -
    You'll note this site's position well down the list.  It's there for
    a reason.  The documentation provided here is very sketchy and
    frankly incredibly misleading in places.  The authors seem to have
    weaseled out of writing a more complete documentation set by making
    a vacuous assertion along the lines of "Well, it's just like regular
    Visual Basic, with a few minor differences".  This leaves people
    like myself who have never had the need to touch a fully fledged VB
    implementation out in the cold, feeling like second class citizens. 
    While these pages can be useful for occasional clarification on some
    obscure language feature, those seeking to understand how the
    language works in the large should definitely look elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308364"&gt;Windows Script Debugging Microsoft KB
    Article&lt;/a&gt; - This article will
    get you started interactively debugging your scripts using Visual
    Studio.  Don't bother with the Windows Script Debugger, Visual
    Studio Express is free and much better :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/vbscript/default.asp"&gt;W3Schools VBScript
    Tutorial/Reference&lt;/a&gt; -
    This page is definitely rather Web-centric, focusing on VBScript in
    classic ASP programming, however, the core language and some of the
    techniques are the same.  In many cases this is a better reference
    than the MSDN one, and the tutorial lets you work through the
    examples online in a web browser which is cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who turned the lights out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that some script you've inherited is not working, but you
get exactly zero output or errors, look for the telltale
&lt;code&gt;On Error Goto 0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;On Error Resume Next&lt;/code&gt; statements. These basically
disable VBScript's inherent error handling functionality and cause your
script to silently ignore errors. Helpful, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Never run while blind folded.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know how you're invoking your VBScript. If you're calling your script
from an installer or some such executable, you're likely using
Microsoft's &lt;code&gt;cscript&lt;/code&gt; tool. which doesn't do a very good job of always
displaying handy things like syntax or run time errors. Try running your
script with &lt;code&gt;wscript&lt;/code&gt; instead for debugging purposes. Heretofore
mysterious behavior may become clear :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's all!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post will prove useful to some poor soul, manacled in
place, suffering through their own personal Windows induced hell. Even
if it isn't, these tidbits have been rattling around in my head since I
escaped (I now work for &lt;a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com" title="Blue State Digital: Design. Strategy. Technology"&gt;Blue State
Digital&lt;/a&gt;,
we're a LAMPs shop (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and I hope to never be
trapped in Windows enterprise limbo again!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2010 15:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-03-31:windows-scripting-a-vbscript-survival-guide.html</guid><category>deployment</category><category>Installers</category><category>microsoft</category><category>powershell</category><category>scripting</category><category>systems</category><category>vbscript</category><category>visual basic</category><category>Windows</category></item><item><title>3 Things Microsoft Should Do for Release Engineers</title><link>/3-things-microsoft-should-do-for-release-engineers.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For the last year or so I've been working at a 100% Windows based
enterprise development shop.   They ship a fairly large and complex
application for health insurance providers, which draws on many of the
core technologies in the Microsoft enterprise stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post highlights a few things that make working in this environment
a whole lot more onerous than it needs to be in my opinion, so let's get
started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Installers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows installation landscape has been a bleak one indeed for a
very long time.  Tools like Installshield with their own proprietary
languages like InstallScript make installer development unnecessarily
painful and baroque.  Is there &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; any reason I should be
programming in a language with no real data structures to speak of in
2010?  Even flow of control is handled in a way I can only describe as
baroque.  There are methods/functions, but the main body of your
installer's code has to jump around everywhere using goto.  What a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope on this front, in the form of
&lt;a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" title="WiX - Windows Installer XML"&gt;WiX&lt;/a&gt;, the
Windows Installer XML toolkit, which allows developers to iteratively
build and design their installer along with the regular development
process.  Right now however the learning curve seems incredibly steep. 
Perhaps Visual Studio could generate a template WiX project to get
people started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also love to see some thought given to simplifying the deployment
model for things like
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685978%28VS.85%29.aspx" title="COM+"&gt;COM+&lt;/a&gt; -
which feels to me like a magic black box with myriad buttons and levers,
all of which are a bear to get right at install time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Builds/SCM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSBuild needs to have &lt;strong&gt;dramatically&lt;/strong&gt; better documentation, and to a
lesser extent so does TFS  - they get the broad bits right - everything
you could want to do through the UI is covered, but process automation
using scripting / command line tools gets substantially murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 'credit where credit is due' department, the TFS team has been
incredibly responsive on their forums, and that's what's helped us get
by so far, but there's no substitute for first rate docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Infrastructure Scripting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now, there are a thousand different interfaces to accomplish
the same thing, and for complex configuration tasks like configuring IIS
at install time, the possibilities can be dizzying.  I would like to see
Microsoft choose &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; mechanism for run-time system/software
configuration and document the heck out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to the
&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/" title="Windows PowerShell"&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;
team and &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd901334.aspx" title="The Scripting Guys"&gt;The Scripting
Guys&lt;/a&gt;
for making great strides in this area.  PowerShell is a really nice
environment for all kinds of scripting, and I look forward to the day
when we can eliminate VBScript from our installers entirely in its
favor, but we're not there yet sadly.  The object pipeline is one of the
more powerful concepts in the modern scripting milieu, and I think Apple
and the UNIX world could take a page from PowerShell's book in this
regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a release engineer in a Windows world presents some very
interesting and different challenges for someone coming from a UNIX
background like myself, and with a little bit of emphasis and effort on
Microsoft's part, surmounting them could be a whole lot less painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2010 13:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-01-28:3-things-microsoft-should-do-for-release-engineers.html</guid><category>infrastructure</category><category>Installers</category><category>installshield</category><category>microsoft</category><category>msbuild</category><category>powershell</category><category>release</category><category>releng</category><category>scripting</category><category>tfs</category><category>Windows</category></item><item><title>Why NOT to vote for Scott Brown for MA Senate</title><link>/why-not-to-vote-for-scott-brown-for-ma-senate.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

Like any civic minded person about to vote in tomorrow's MA senatorial
election tomorrow, I was browsing the candidates websites so I could
make an informed choice.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

I am honestly not the biggest Coakley fan, but given the two choices
she's a shining star compared to Scott Brown.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no issue with most of the points he puts forth in the "Issues"
section of his website, right up until we get to "Marriage" -
conveninetly located third from the bottom, just above "Israel" and
"Iran".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. States should be free to make their own laws in this area, so long as they reflect the people's will as expressed through them directly, or as expressed through their elected representatives. {style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of state's rights, but let's view this in context - here
in Massachusetts, same sex marriage is 100% legal.  If Mr. Brown is
elected, he will strip our state of one of its proudest moments in
recent memory, plunging us back into the darkness of ignorance,
discrimination and fear that has held sway since time immemorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a heterosexual man who has been blessed by the gift of marriage in my
life, I can't even begin to express how strongly I feel about this
issue.  To me, denying our fellow men and women this right because they
happen to be attracted to people of the same sex is so morally repugnant
as to be beyond words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not allow the army of small mindedness and ignorance to douse the
light of truth and plunge our fair state into darkness once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether straight, gay, yellow or purple, if you care about the basic
rights and freedoms that make our nation as great as it is, go vote
tomorrow, and vote against Scott Brown.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2010 12:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2010-01-18:why-not-to-vote-for-scott-brown-for-ma-senate.html</guid><category>civil rights</category><category>gay rights</category><category>marriage</category><category>massachusetts</category><category>politics</category><category>same sex</category><category>senate</category></item><item><title>Bananagrams!</title><link>/bananagrams.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Michelle and I have been having a lot of fun playing this game lately.
It's a must play if you're a word game fan of any stripe, and even if
you don't generally enjoy board games (especially if you find them too
slow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this one unique is that it all happens in real time. My
lovely wife is a real shark at this and every other word game we've
played, but we both end up having a lot more fun with this than most
others we've tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;grata&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that for many people, it is the epitome of bland political
correctness – however for me, it’s what I &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t want to wish you a Merry Christmas, or a happy
&lt;span&gt;Channukah&lt;/span&gt;, or a blessed Ramadan, because I don’t know if
you celebrate any of those things. What I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; want to say is
that I hope you have a happy, enjoyable, peaceful and serene holiday
with your friends, family, or whoever else it is you enjoy having
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Happy Holidays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2009 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2009-12-18:the-anti-political-correctness-backlash.html</guid><category>backlash</category><category>correct</category><category>cranky</category><category>customs</category><category>greetings</category><category>holidays</category><category>politically</category><category>social</category><category>society</category></item><item><title>Is it just me...</title><link>/is-it-just-me.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Or has the number of new programming languages been increasing
exponentially of late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't just mean the number of new languages being &lt;strong&gt;invented&lt;/strong&gt;,
because that's always been the case, but the number which are actually
garnering a fair bit of tech buzz?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I've heard a LOT about Clojure, Scala, Factor,
and most recently Google's Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help but wonder if maybe we should stop inventing new
programming languages and paradigms, and maybe focus on using the ones
we have already more effectively and creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe I'm just getting old :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2009 14:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2009-11-13:is-it-just-me.html</guid><category>clojure</category><category>computers</category><category>development</category><category>factor</category><category>go</category><category>invention</category><category>languages</category><category>programming</category><category>scala</category><category>technology</category></item><item><title>Aruba - Take 2</title><link>/aruba-take-2.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just (well, a week ago, but work was blazing white hot upon my return,
so no time to write :) got back from a week in Aruba, and my experience
this time around was &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; different...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_52" align="alignnone" width="225"

&lt;p&gt;This time, we rented a time share my wife's boss graciously allowed us
to occupy at well below market rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was positively awesome.  We were at the &lt;a href="http://www.playalinda.com/" title="Playa Linda Time Share"&gt;Playa
Linda&lt;/a&gt; time share,
sandwiched between some of the better hotels along the beach (We had the
Westin on one side, and the Hyatt, Radison, Occidental and finally the
Taj/Ritz on the other.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always been rather down on time sharing - who wants to go to the
same place every year? Well, my eyes have been opened.  We're not about
to go running to buy one (We still want to visit a bunch more places
first) but I can now absolutely see settling down someplace that you
love to come back to every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit we rented was very nice.  You get a separate sleeping area, a
nice little living room with 2 couches (one fold out in case you have
guests) and a decent size LCD TV.  The kitchenette is equipped with
everything you'd need to keep house for a week - pots, pans, dishes,
silverware, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had amazing weather while we were there, it was in the 90's most of
the time, but with those trade marked Aruban trade winds, it didn't feel
opressively hot at all (Though you really have to watch out for the
tropical sun, it can kick your butt :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach where we were sat in between two piers, so there's no terrible
rip tide threatening to pull you out to sea.  The sand is coral, rather
than granite based like the beaches in NH around here, so it's silky
smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent our days going from pool to beach, seeing the sights on the
island and having dinner either with our hosts (who graciously cooked
two amazing meals for us while we were there) or taking advantage of
some of the excellent restaurants on the island like &lt;a href="http://www.madamejanette.info/" title="Madame Jeanette's"&gt;Madame
Jeanette's&lt;/a&gt; - it's a
uniquely Caribbean restaurant in that the seating is largely outdoors. 
If you visit the island, that's definitely one not to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I'd taken a camera other than my iPhone along with us (I kept it
in the room most of the time for fear it would melt :) there was
wildlife everythere.  Sand Pipers, Turns, and Iguanas were all sharing
the pool and beach with us, which my wife and I enjoyed immensely (Some
other guests not so much, people get freaked out by lizards for some
reaosn :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was a week of utter fun and relaxation in the sun, and we'll
definitely be back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cpatti</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2009 12:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2009-10-12:aruba-take-2.html</guid><category>aruba</category><category>beach</category><category>travel</category><category>tropical</category><category>vacation</category></item></channel></rss>
