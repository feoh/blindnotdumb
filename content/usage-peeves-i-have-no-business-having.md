I am at best a poor writer. Even so, certain things get under my skin...

<!--more-->

-   If I never hear or see the word "the" intentionally misspelled as
    "teh" again, I will be a happy man.
-   3lyt3 5p3ak can just **GO AWAY** too, really.
-   Just sayin'. This may have been effective about 20 years ago when
    the first person who propagated this
    [meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"),
    but now it's tired. So **very** tired.
-   [ebonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics "Ebonics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") -
    I like rap. A good friend many years ago in college walked up to me
    one day when I was ranting at some friends about how I thought rap
    was just chaotic noise and nothing else, and said "Rap is one of the
    most politically active forms of music on the planet, and that's a
    fact.". He was right. All that's beside the point though, ebonics
    are seeping their way into main stream speech in ways I find most
    unfortunate. It can stop any time now.
-   Wassssssuupppppp!!! - the original Bud marketing campaign was
    brilliant, and even funny in spots (I still enjoy the sushi bar
    version - Wasabii!!!) but this meme is so tired it needs to be taken
    out back and shot - a mercy kill at that.
-   Calling everyone "Kid" whether they be 18 or 80 - Maybe the denizens
    of Southie can get grand fathered in on this one, I dunno, but the
    rest of you should really stop watching those Martin Scorsese.

As I said above, I realize that in truth I have no business at all
airing my English usage peeves, because in truth I am a sloppy writer
and a downright poor grammarian. But anyway, I feel better having gotten
them off my chest :).
