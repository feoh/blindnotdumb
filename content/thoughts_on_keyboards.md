I've recently been very underwhelmed with the keyboards Apple ships with their computers. They're trying to make them all feel like laptop keyboards, which is an idea I
rather disapprove of.

In particular the recent [Apple Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa) has such shallow key travel it's very easy
to fall into the bad habit of pounding the keys, and the overall layout feels squished and constrained.2015

I've had a couple of the old school model A1408 "Apple Keyboard" (and its wireless cousin) in my drawer for years because I remember liking them.2015

Thus far it's definitely a big improvement over the current squashed and squishy laptop like keyboard, but my gold standard for keyboards is the
[Razor Black Widow Ultimate](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blackwidow-ultimate) - I use one at work with my Linux desktop PC and it feels glorious to type on.  Beautiful
mechanical keys with very distinct tactile feedback and a satisfying (if perhaps somewhat loud for your officemates :) click.2015

The original Apple keyboard definitely has a better typing feel but lacks the tactile feedback of the Razor or other modern mechanical keyboards making the typing feel still come
off a bit squishy for my tastes.

I may end up investigating other modern mechanical keyboards to replace them - we'll see. One irritation I have with the Razor is that they're platform specific. Is there REALLY
any good reason for this other than to try to get me to shell out another $100 for yet another keyboard? I rather resent that as other brands seem to cope just fine in both
platforms.
