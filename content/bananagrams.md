Michelle and I have been having a lot of fun playing this game lately.
It's a must play if you're a word game fan of any stripe, and even if
you don't generally enjoy board games (especially if you find them too
slow).

What makes this one unique is that it all happens in real time. My
lovely wife is a real shark at this and every other word game we've
played, but we both end up having a lot more fun with this than most
others we've tried.

Two thumbs up.
