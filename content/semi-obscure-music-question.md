Read no further if you think Phish is just a misspelling of those things
with fins and scales......

Does anyone know which Phish album and song contains an A Cappella
version of the mourner's kaddish?

I know it's out there somewhere because I've heard it multiple times, I
just can't for the life of me remember which album it's on.

 **Update**

The answer is that it's not the mourner's kaddish, but is instead a
Jewish funerary song called "Jerusalem, City of Gold" and is included at
the end of the song "Demand" on Phish's "Hoist" album.  View most of the
