Blah blah blah rip the movie using MakeMKV

Then, you get a directory full of MKVs like this:

|MovieRipBlogPost-raw.png|

First, look up the movie title in TheMovieDB:

Then, view each MKV file one by one and figure out what each track is.

(Describe VLC menu <-> Track correlation trick)

Now, Rename the title track:

|MovieRipBlogPost - title|

Now, view each of the remaining tracks to figure out what to do with them.

In this case, the remaining tracks are garbage of a kind you'll find quite common in your movie ripping endeavors. They're short (usually less than a minute) tracks with nothing more than the swooshing logo like the Universal globe or the Columbia logo writ large. Delete them, they serve no purpose in your Plex library.
