This is one of those rare occasions when I have nothing more to say than
a brief status update...

<!--more-->

Life has been good, but **busy**.

At work, the [Maven
2](http://maven.apache.org/ "Maven - Welcome to Maven") transition is
slated to happen this weekend. If we can carry it off successfully, I
will be able to trundle off across the pond with a giant weight lifted
from my shoulders as we've been working towards this for months.

Speaking of trundling off across the pond - We're headed to Ireland next
week. We're in that frenzied pre vacation phase where we're trying to
ensure that we take everything we need while still traveling
(comparatively) light. This is all very exciting for me, as it'll be my
first trip to Europe, and also my first international vacation as a
married man :)

It is a tour, which honestly I was not entirely thrilled at the prospect
of at first (I tend to like to identify my own points of interest and
see them at my own pace) but I'm comforted by the idea that we'll be
spending a full two days at each destination so at least I don't have to
worry about being whisked from place to place in rapid fire succession
(I **HATE** that!).

Anyway, that's all for now. More when I return :) Hope this note finds
everyone well!
