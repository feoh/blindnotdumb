My wife and I are just beginning to find our 'sea legs' when it comes to
cooking...

<!--more-->

We were both definitely the kind of people who ate out most of the time
for a big chunk of our adult lives, and who didn't pay nearly as much
attention as we should have to our parents in the kitchen.

It's been a bit of a process coming up to speed with cooking for
ourselves on a regular basis, and evolving past the point of things like
pasta, simple grilling, and simple frying, and getting to the point
where we have a small repertoire of recipes we're very comfortable with.

A few potentially obvious things that are worth restating anyway:

-   If cooking for yourself beyond boiling water seems daunting, Just Do
    It. That feeling abates after the first few successes in the
    kitchen.
-   Don't bite off more than you can chew. Start with recipes that
    involve only a few steps. Better to build your confidence with
    several small, satisfying victories than to go out with a bang and
    resign yourself to eternal take out again.
-   Working with a partner is much more fun, and besides, then you'll
    have someone to share dinner with :)
-   Slow cookers are awesome. Nothing says "Hey, even I can't screw this
    up!" like a recipe that calls for cooking something on LOW for 8-9
    hours. In fact, I have a pot roast bubbling away in mine at home
    right now :)
-   Try the no knead bread recipe! It's idiot proof. I should know, I've
    succeeded at using it twice and made two lovely loaves of bread -
    very well reviewed by everyone we had handy both times :) The recipe
    originally appeared in the [New York
    Times](www.http://www.nytimes.com/) but my favorite rendition which
    includes some nice refinements and is a whole lot more fun is [over
    here](http://steamykitchen.com/blog/2007/09/10/no-knead-bread-revisited/)
    on the [Jaden's Steamy Kitchen](http://steamykitchen.com) blog.

Now for the less obvious stuff, and the reason I bothered writing this
to begin with.

Good Kitchen Tools are Worth Their Weight in Gold
-------------------------------------------------

For years I had always said "Well, I'm hardly a kitchen maven, so I
really don't need the good stuff. What I have is fine." What I had was a
worn out mish mash of hand me downs from my family that I had been using
since my dorm days in college. Dull knives, cheap pots and pans with hot
spots galore that looked like they'd been through a world war or two.
You get the idea.

Boy, was I wrong! When we got married and my wife and were prompted by
several of her relatives to start a wedding registry, I thought, "This
is an opportunity to get the Good Stuff". Due to the tremendous
generosity of our families and friends we ended up with a nice set of
[All-Clad](http://www.all-clad.com/) cook ware and
[Henckels](http://www.jahenckels.com/) knives.

I was blown away. It's the classic [Boiled
Frog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiled_frog) syndrome. You really
have no idea how much easier and more pleasant it is to cook with good
tools until you have them in your home and use them a few times. The
difference really is like night and day. In the same vein, it's been
really nice to watch my wife use one of these tools for the first time
and say "Hey, wow, this is a really great knife" or "It's amazing how
you easy this pan is to clean" etc.

I don't want to come off sounding like an advertisement for either of
these two product lines - I am quite certain that any of the other
equivalently capable lines of kitchen tools will lend the same kind of
pleasure to your kitchen endeavors.

Anyway, writing something like this has been rattling around in my head
for a while. I know I wasn't the only kitchen phobic geek out there, so
I thought some of this bore mentioning. Hopefully it's not totally
incoherent, and people can get something out of it. Have fun!
