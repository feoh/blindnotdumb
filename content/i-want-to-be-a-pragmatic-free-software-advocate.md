# I Want To Be A Pragmatic Free Software Advocate

In the wake of [Richard Stallman's surprise announcement](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/free-software-foundation-and-rms-issue-statements-on-stallmans-return/) and the resultant controversy I've been thinking a lot about the past, present, and future of the free software movement.

I have never been a big contributor to open source. For a long time, I lacked the necessary software development chops, and lately, now that I've grown them over the last couple of years, I simply don't have the time to dive in on top of the very full time job I have with AWS.

However I have very strong feelings about the moment and its importance to my own life and livelihood as well as to the larger world.

I have a couple of small "scratch your own itch" projects on [My Github](https://github.com/feoh) but I have hopes of eventually finding the time to dive deep into the projects I care about and move the ball forward.
