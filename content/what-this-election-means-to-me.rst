For me, this election is personal.

When a candidate and the party that backs him set out to legislate what goes on in the bedroom (telling us who to love and marry) and in the doctor's office (making decisions about my reproductive health and that of my wife) it's an affront to me and every like minded American.

Mitt Romney has vowed to do everything in his power to repeal Roe V. Wade. I do not understand even from a common sense perspective as a reasonable adult how this makes any sense. How will returning to an era where women lived in fear and abortions were grisly deeds performed in back alleys with coat hangers benefit the American people?

I have Catholic acquaintances who speak of advocating for the baby, yet they leave out the bit where all these children are carried to term and brought into a life lived in squalid conditions and being cared for by people who are neither capable nor willing to do so.

Then there is the issue of marriage. I find the mere idea that an aspirant to rule would attempt to dictate the gender of the person I choose to take as my life partner repugnant and offensive to the core.

Some of my best friends in this world are gay. In fact, one of them actually performed the marriage ceremony for my wife and I. Just thinking about the fact that Mr. Romney would try to sever the holy bonds of matrimony that he shares with his husband makes me **angry.**

In my ideal world, government would not be in the business of marriage at all, but that isn't the world we live in today. I applaud the Obama campaign for having had the courage to stand up and say "This isn't right. Let's fix it.". The naysayers will be quick to point out that this change in attitude was politically motivated, and maybe it was, but really? Who cares? That makes it no less right.

I have been hearing a lot of unhappy people of late expressing dissatisfaction with president Obama and his administration, particularly around jobs and the economy. To my mind, he inherited some of the worst economic conditions of any incoming president in the history of our nation, and while many would dispute this point I feel very strongly that the president has done and will continue to do a bang up job making the best of this awful mess the last 8 years of Republican rule have left us in.

Economy aside for a moment, I am proud to be doing my part to give the president the time he needs to get the job done. This isn't about politics for me, it's about fighting the good fight because it's the right thing to do.
