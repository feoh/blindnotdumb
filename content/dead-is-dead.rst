I had a rather 'meta' moment today after reading another article bemoaning the death of the PC as a gaming platform (An assertion of at best dubious nature).

| 
| Taking a step back, I realized that just about every single instance of someone wailing "X is DEAD!" turned out to either be patently untrue or at least a severely twisted view of the facts at hand.

| "The desktop is dead. The web \*IS\* the platform!"
| "PC gaming is dead. Next gen consoles rule supreme!"
| "Disco is dead!"
| "God is dead!"
| "Paul is (a) dead(man)!"
| "Table top role playing is dead!"

You get the idea. Clearly, we need to re-examine our conceptions around exactly what it means for something to be dead.

"This blog is DEAD!"

Ahem. Maybe not :)
