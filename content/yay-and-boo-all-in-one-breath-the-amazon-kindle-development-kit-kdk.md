This is absolutely great news for the J2ME development community, this
is a mainstream device from a big name manufacturer where they can ply
their existing skill set or port their existing apps.

However, I'm a bit disappointed. I realize that the Kindle is meant as a
light weight device, but I have always found J2ME's I/O model to be
rather cripplingly baroque in so many ways.

Looking over Amazon's APIDoc however, it does seem like they've built
their own infrastructure atop J2ME, so perhaps they've made it easier
and more pleasant to code for.

I'm torn between wanting to get in on the ground floor and not wanting
to invest the time and energy in learning a technology (J2ME) which I
feel has gone way past its expiry date.

Anyway, we'll see but I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on this
one.
