I had a rather 'meta' moment today after reading another article
bemoaning the death of the PC as a gaming platform (An assertion of at
best dubious nature).

Taking a step back, I realized that just about every single instance of
someone wailing "X is DEAD!" turned out to either be patently untrue or
at least a severely twisted view of the facts at hand.

"The desktop is dead. The web \*IS\* the platform!"  
"PC gaming is dead. Next gen consoles rule supreme!"  
"Disco is dead!"  
"God is dead!"  
"Paul is (a) dead(man)!"  
"Table top role playing is dead!"

You get the idea. Clearly, we need to re-examine our conceptions around
exactly what it means for something to be dead.

"This blog is DEAD!"

Ahem. Maybe not :)
