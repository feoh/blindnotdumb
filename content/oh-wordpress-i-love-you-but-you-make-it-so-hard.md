It feels like there are new security issues around WordPress every week.

<!--more-->

Admittedly, the fact that WordPress automatically updates itself helps
**a lot**, but it does lead one to wonder if a simpler solution might
make more sense.

I really like the idea of a static generator tool
like [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), but also really enjoy
blogging from my mobile devices with tools
like [Blogsy](http://blogsyapp.com/).

One friend suggested using Pelican, and using Github's built-in editor
to create the Markdown, so I suppose I should explore that.

What I would **really **love to see is a solution where I could compose
on my mobile devices in Markdown, then somehow get those changes checked
into Github so I could statically generate my blog later from a
computer.

Apparently, I want everything :)

A middle of the road solution might be to simply give up and
let [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) manage my blog, but I think
it's helpful to keep some skin in the game and run my own site given
that I build infrastructure for a living.

If anyone reading this has any amazing solutions to the problems I pose
here I'd love to hear about it!
