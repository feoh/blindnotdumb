Since when did "**Happy Holidays"**<span> become persona non
<span>grata</span>?</span>

I realize that for many people, it is the epitome of bland political
correctness – however for me, it’s what I **want** to say!

<span>I don’t want to wish you a Merry Christmas, or a happy
<span>Channukah</span>, or a blessed Ramadan, because I don’t know if
you celebrate any of those things. What I</span>**do** want to say is
that I hope you have a happy, enjoyable, peaceful and serene holiday
with your friends, family, or whoever else it is you enjoy having
around.

So, Happy Holidays!

That's all :)
