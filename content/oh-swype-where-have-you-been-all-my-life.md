For years my Android using friends have been revving about
[Swype](http://www.swype.com).

When tablets and smartphones first appeared on the scene, many of us
were so awash in the glow of our shiny new toys that we overlooked a
glaring weak point - text input.

In a stunning display of uncreative design, the keyboards for these
devices were simply 'virtualized' versions of their mechanical
counterparts.

The result seems like a regular keyboard, but bereft of the comparative
elegance and efficiency of touch typing we are left in an incredibly
unsatisfying state of perpetual hunt and peck. To add insult to injury,
this ethereal target we're eternally stabbing at changes underneath us
to suit the whim of the author of whichever app we're using.

With Swype, one simply glides one's finger from letter to letter
spelling our words. Swype handles tedious details like putting spaces
between words or after periods.

I could keep babbling, but suffice it to say it has been a life changer
for me. Paired with [Blogsy](http://blogsyapp.com "Blogsy"), my iPad
blogging ttyl of choice, you may be hearing from me more often!
