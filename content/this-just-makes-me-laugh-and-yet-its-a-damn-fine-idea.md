Using hip hop as a teaching tool for English.

Go take a look at [Flocabulary](http://www.flocabulary.com/)

The piece that actually left me chuckling on this snowy wet morning was
[this](http://www.flocabulary.com/shakessample2.html "Love's Desire - Shakespeare is Hip-Hop").
A Hip hopped up Cliffs Notes version of Romeo and Juliet.

I love the idea - speaking to kids using a medium they're comfortable
with. In no way do I think this should replace a full and careful
reading with explanations by the teacher, but for some children there's
a lot of ground to cover before they're able or ready to be successful
in such an endeavor.

Kudos to [The Mighty Red
Pen](http://mightyredpen.wordpress.com/ "Mighty Red Pen") for coming up
with this. For those who don't read it, I highly recommend it. It's
funny and educational - it doesn't get much better than that!
