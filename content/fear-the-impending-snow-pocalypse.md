I am being amused watching people run around panicking over the coming
snow.

THIS IS NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE. IT SNOWS HERE! GET USED TO IT!

Actually, I'm looking forward to this storm. Unlike the freezing rain
and ice issues we've had of late, you can actually frolic and play in
the white fluffy stuff and not get yourself killed :)
