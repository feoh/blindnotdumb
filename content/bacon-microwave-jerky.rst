If you'll indulge me for just a few moments I want to say a few words on a topic that's near and dear to my heart: Bacon!

I've encountered more than a few people who think that cooking bacon in the microwave is the way to go. Far be it from me to dictate anyone's tastes, but I've gotta say folks, if you r\ *really* love bacon like I do, you should at least give cooking it in the oven a try.

Not that bacon cooked in a microwave isn't tasty. Far from it in fact, but what you wind up with is in fact something akin to bacon jerky. Bacon jerky can be a very tasty treat, but you haven't lived until you've tried `Martha Stewart's super simple recipe <http://www.marthastewart.com/264476/less-mess-bacon%7D>`__ for cooking bacon in the oven.

It comes out juicy yet crispy, with all the subtle flavor that make bacon an amazing taste treat.

To top of all off, cleanup is a breeze. No splatters mess on the stove.

[Editorial note: I seem to end up blogging a lot while flying. Maybe it's being trapped in a steel box for six hours. In any case, if all goes well this is the first one I've managed to post from the air as well. Yay living in the future!]
