|cropped-2017-01-15_13-53-02_000.jpeg|\ My name is `Chris Patti <mailto:cpatti@gmail.com>`__ and I'm a DevOps engineer for a thoroughly awesome company - `Amazon Web Services <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__. Note that my opinions are mine and not my employers (That should go without saying, but anyway).

In the off hours I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife, playing games of all kinds (but especially those involving face to face human interaction like board games or tabletop RPGs), reading (I have a rather severe case of bibliophilia which I've had to throttle back quite a bit now that I'm sharing my life with someone. Thankfully, she's very understanding :), and dabbling in digital art.
