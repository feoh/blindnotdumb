Recently, pretty much the entire geek/fandom community was in full on
mourning over the death of fantasy author [Terry
Pratchett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett "Terry Pratchett").

He was incredibly prolific, authoring scores of books, but nearest and
dearest to my heart are his
[Discworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) books and [Good
Omens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens) which he co-authored
with another of my favorite writers, [Neil
Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/).

His death was no surprise to anyone as he had made his fight with
Alzheimer's public, but that doesn't make his loss any less keenly felt
by his fans.

In response his fans created the [GNU Terry
Pratchett](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/) project.

I won't repeat the superb explanation the site gives (Go take a look,
it'll cost you maybe 30 seconds and is really quite delightful :) but
suffice it to say we geeks can be fairly inventive about remembering our
dead.

Suffice it to say that whenever you read my blog you will, in some small
whimsical way, be honoring his memory.

RIP Terry Pratchett.  I will be laughing out loud while reading your
work for some years to come :)
