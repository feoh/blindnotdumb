For years I've been rather proud of the fact that I'm a total polyglot
when it  
comes to editors. I'm comfortable on both sides of the fence, using
Emacs, Vi,  
TextMate, EditPlus, or even the venerable /bin/ed whenever that makes
sense.  
<!--more-->  
But for the first time in a long time, my current (awesome! :)) job at
[Blue  
State Digital](http://www.bluestatedigital.com) has given me the
opportunity to  
branch out and do quite a bit of real software development.

I first encountered TextMate shortly after I came to OSX. It's a great
editor,  
and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Alan Odegard of
[Macromates](http://www.macromates.com)  
software. He has just about single handedly created not only an
amazing  
editor, but a vibrant and loyal community around his program, and he's
to be  
commended for that.

I would have remained happy in TextMate land, but for the fact that my
most  
recent job has me going back to where it all started for me - server
side UNIX,  
Linux to be exact.

So, I editing files on my Mac using Expandrive to remotely mount them,
but  
quite frankly that's a pain in the neck I just don't need to deal with.

With Vim, I can memorize one set of keystrokes for everywhere I might
need to  
be.

And with MacVim, I get a nicely streamlined, beautifully Aqua-fied
interface,  
with all the creature comforts TextMate provides and more.

What's more, there are a number of folks making the same transition, so
there  
are some excellent articles and websites out there to ease the
transition like  
[this guide on making the  

switch](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/09/05/textmate-to-vim.html#masthead)
or  
the excellent [VimCasts](http://vimcasts.org) series of Vim tutorial
screen  
casts. They cover everything from the basics to some fairly advanced
tips and  
tricks on more complex Vim modes and integrations, and is written by a
TextMate  
to Vim switcher.

Right now I'm writing this post on the excellent  
[VimRePress](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3510)
plugin for  
Vim that allows you to author and manage your Wordpress blog right from
within  
the editor! Very sweet :)

So, it's a brave new world, and I'm excited by the opportunity to get  
**really** good at Vim so I can push my editing productivity through
the roof  
:)
