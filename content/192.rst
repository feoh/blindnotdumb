I have to confess one of the silly things about now having successfully ripped every CD we own is taking stock of all the music I've **lost** over the years.

Silly in the sense that most of it's mainstream stuff that's readily replaceable, and doubly silly in that I'm finding myself sentimentally attached to \*THAT\* CD. You know, the one I carted home from college that moved with me all 250 times through the years.

Something to ponder is that in the era of all things digital where people don't even USE physical objects to embody music anymore, this kind of thing just won't happen. Maybe it's sad, maybe it's not, but it's definitely worthy of some thought so we don't throw the baby out with the bath water as we're so fond of doing in the modern era.
