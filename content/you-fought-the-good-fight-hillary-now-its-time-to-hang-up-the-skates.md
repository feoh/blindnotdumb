I heard on the news this morning that Hillary only has between a 5 and
10 percent chance of winning the nomination at this point...

And the question I keep asking myself is: Why is she still in the race?
What does she hope to gain? Is she so selfishly myopic that she's
willing to tank the democratic party's chances for winning this
election?

My respect for her and those around her is dwindling rapidly.

Come on Hillary, wake up and smell the coffee. It's time you started
thinking more about the nation you claim to care about and less about
the bruised ego you'll have to endure if you lose.

I hope Obama continues to run a classy campaign - I realize that some
retaliation is necessary in order to be seen as a tenacious and forceful
candidate, but people grow fickle and cynical **very** quickly,
especially with many on both sides of the party line feeling like McCain
is a lesser evil (I don't agree with this, but it **is** a commonly held
opinion right now.)

With 300 days until Bush leaves office, I want to be doing the touch
down dance at election time along with hundreds and thousands of other
Americans who feel like we've been misled and mismanaged for too many
years.
