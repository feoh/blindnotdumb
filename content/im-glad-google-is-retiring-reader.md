Because I and about a zillion other jilted Reader fans have now found
[Feedly](http://www.feedly.com).

Feedly is what Reader wanted to be when it grew up, but never had the
chance to become.

Yes, it's that good.

Just in case anyone out there reading this is thinking "Google What?" -
here's the skinny.  If you find yourself reading a lot of websites on a
regular basis, constantly checking back to keep up to date with the
latest, you REALLY want a feed reader like this.  With something like
this, you can treat them all as if you were browsing articles in a
newspaper or magazine, either slavishly reading every one or, as I do,
cherry picking what most piques your interest from the stream (or
firehose as we geeks like to refer to it :)

Things I love about [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com "Feedly"):

-   Keyboard commands for everything - I'm a mouse hater from way back.
     Force me to click at your peril :)
-   Multiple views - I can either view my stream the good old fashioned
    way like Reader used to do - just a big old list of text headlines,
    or like a newspaper with photos front and center.
-   A 'Must Read' setting for the 1% of blogs I really don't want to
    miss a single post from.
-   A truly superb mobile app! Can't overstate how important this is.
     The iPad and iPhone apps are optimized for that format, yet as
    feature-ful as the desktop.  Major win! (Reader sucked at this,
    using it on the go was paaaainful.).
-   Laziness - if you already use Reader as I did, all your feeds import
    seamlessly into Feedly, and while Reader still breathes, Feedly
    keeps it up to date so there's zero risk in giving it a try.
-   OK I know I already mentioned the mobile experience but the iPhone
    app deserves special mention, it makes it \*so\* easy to browse my
    feeds on the go, marking articles I actually want to read in-depth
    for later perusal via one of my other faves,
    [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com "Pocket").

<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 16px;">Seriously, mad props
to the folks at [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com "Feedly") for evolving
the state of the art, giving me a seamless migration path, and generally
taking an OK but generally pretty lackluster experience and elevating it
to joy.</span>

(And no, I'm not being paid by these guys, I'm just wild about the
product.)
