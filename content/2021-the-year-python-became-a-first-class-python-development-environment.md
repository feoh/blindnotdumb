Summary: Windows makes for a compelling choice for Python developers in 2021.


As I've written about previously and elsewhere, I felt so badly burned by Apple's laptop
hardware design decisions of a few years ago that I've rather fallen out of love with that platform for my personal work. The latest hardware is much better, but I feel like the message has been sent and received, so I'm not rushing back any time soon.

My first choice was the Linux desktop, and after months of struggling, instability and accessibility issues I'll admit I've been looking for stable, solid alternatives that are also powerful enough to get the job done and maybe even have something new to offer. As an old dog, sometimes it's really nice to be taught some new tricks!
