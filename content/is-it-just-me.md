Or has the number of new programming languages been increasing
exponentially of late?

I don't just mean the number of new languages being **invented**,
because that's always been the case, but the number which are actually
garnering a fair bit of tech buzz?

In the last few months, I've heard a LOT about Clojure, Scala, Factor,
and most recently Google's Go.

I can't help but wonder if maybe we should stop inventing new
programming languages and paradigms, and maybe focus on using the ones
we have already more effectively and creatively.

Then again, maybe I'm just getting old :)
