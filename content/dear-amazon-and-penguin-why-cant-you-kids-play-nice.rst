I received a piece of E-mail from Amazon a few days back apologizing about the fact that my pre-order of the latest `Jim Butcher <www.jimbutcher.com>`__ Dresden Files novel had been canceled, offering me a really cheap price on the print edition.

A couple of days and a great deal of "WTF?" later (That's What The French, this being a family friendly blog and all :) I trotted on over to Jim's website and found an `explanation <https://www.jim-butcher.com/news/000362.php>`__.

Essentially, Amazon and Penguin are bickering over the sale price of the book.

I would \*happily\* pay full hard cover list for the Kindle edition of the newest Dresden novel.Â  Jim Butcher is my favorite urban fantasy author, and when these books come out I get them the very first \*instant\* I can and then become some sort of literary crack fiend, obsessively trying to find excuses to crawl off into a corner and page flip.

   So I guess I'll run down to Porter Square Books and buy the dead tree edition, but this is what I bought my Kindle for!

   On the up side, I've been feeling guilty about not supporting my local independent book seller of late, I guess this is an opportunity to put my money where my mouth is and pony up!
