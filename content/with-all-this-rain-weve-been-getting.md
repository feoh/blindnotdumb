Staring out the window just now at the torrential rains, I had a very
vivid memory of a really pleasant day many years ago...

I was in High School I think, and a friend of mine (He was my 'Big
Brother' actually, a program I was in for kids whose fathers weren't
around so we  
could get some sense of what it's like to be a man - I think it only
partially worked :) ) and I were canoeing around [Lake
Dennison](http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&q=Lake+Dennison,&near=Templeton,+MA&fb=1&view=text&latlng=9446610972854578859&dtab=0&ei=BLGISJHMJomKjAHY9bWhBw&oi=&sa=X# "Google Maps")
in Templeton, MA.

There had been a lot of rain that year too, a LOT of rain, and the
lake's water level was threatening to swell over the top and flood the
beach entirely.  
This made for some beautiful canoeing, since it allowed us to row down
a series of inlets which would normally have been almost totally
inaccessible  
by foot because of the dense brush. It was just gorgeous out there, the
air smelled incredibly lush and green, and there were flowers and small
wild  
life all around - we managed to get within perfect viewing distance of
a doe and her fawn before they pranced away, and we're pretty sure we
disturbed  
the work of a beaver or two that wasn't at all used to the intrusion.

It's funny how when you get older (and I don't even mean ancient either,
just middle aged) memories can take on not just the rosy glow of years
long  
past but a strange intensity all their own.

I stink at canoeing, but I do hope I can go out rowing even on a row
boat or something again someday. I miss those quiet moments on the lake
:)
