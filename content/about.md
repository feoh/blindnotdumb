Slug: about

My name is [Chris Patti](mailto:cpatti@gmail.com) and I'm a DevOps
engineer for a thoroughly awesome company -
[Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com "Carbonite"). Note that my opinions
are mine and not my employers (That should go without saying, but
anyway).

I create and manage build and other infrastructure for Carbonite using
[Chef](http://www.getchef.com "Chef"), and whatever other tools I can
get my hands on.

In the off hours I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife, playing
games of all kinds (but especially those involving face to face human
interaction like board games or tabletop RPGs), reading (I have a rather
severe case of bibliophilia which I've had to throttle back quite a bit
now that I'm sharing my life with someone. Thankfully, she's very
understanding :), and dabbling in digital art.
