Something for nothing when you don't *WANT IT* is still damn annoying.

Dear Sun;

When you tell me I hava Java (TM) updates available on my work Windows machine, I gleefully say sure why not and click through the installer, because generally Sun provided updates to my installed JDK don't do anything evil, and with security and all it's a good idea to stay up to date.

HOWEVER - trying to shoehorn OpenOffice into the mix is downright annoying, and I resent it.

| I don't have anything at all against OpenOffice. In fact, it's a Class A piece of open source software and is damn impressive for what it is, what it does, and how much it costs ($0).

However, I and many other users have exactly zero use for OpenOffice because we have the arguably more powerful Microsoft Office suite already installed on our machines.

I take no issue with having a little checkbox that says "Hey, want to get OpenOffice along with Java?" because at least I can check that off if I want, or not. But having your Java update installer constantly display ads for OpenOffice, and having it give me **no choice** in the matter as to whether or not I want the ferschlugging OpenOffice installer is just wrong.

The software sells itself, Sun, there's no reason to try to sneak it under the radar of unsuspecting users just because you want to be able to claim more seats. Last time you tried this with Netbeans, and look at how well that turned out!

So, get a clue people, really. Truth in advertising, let me do what I mean and don't try to install software that I need whether I realize it or not, it just pisses me off.

Grumph, enough ranting for now :)
