I'm switching the static site generator I ues for this blog from [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/).

There are a number of reasons for this - better/more theme options, a more active development community, and some really swank features I just love.

The up-shot however is that the RSS feeds will need to change. The new links are clearly signposted on the header at the top of the blog.

Also, I've switched the comment system from Disqus (Which I really Dis-like :) to [Intense Debate](https://www.intensedebate.com/) which I've been using on my personal blog and love to bits.

You can find the old Disqus comments [here](https://disqus.com/home/forum/blindnotdumb/)

Thanks for understanding and updating your feed readers!
