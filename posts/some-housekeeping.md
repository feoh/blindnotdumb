Summary: Some necessary housekeeping. Shouldn't take but a minute.

Hi all!

Just a brief house-keeping note.

This is going to hence-forth be strictly my professional blog.

I'll be cleaning out old posts that aren't tech related and *maybe*
moving any I feel particularly inclined to keep over to my new personal
blog, [Playing With Quicksilver](https://playingwithquicksilver.net).

I'm not trying to hide anything, so feel free to browse my old posts via the
Wayback Machine over [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20211225090030/https://www.feoh.org/).

I look forward to blogging here more often! I'll likely also be switching to
the [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) static site generator because it offers 
a number of features and creature comforts that will make my life easier
(Like having a command that will pre-seed a new post with all the right metadata fields. Yay :)

As always feel free to hit me up here or on social media if you have any thoughts.

Onward!
